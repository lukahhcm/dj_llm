July is typically the warmest month of the year globally, running about 3 to 4 degrees Celsius (5 to 7 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than January.\nThis is because most of the planet’s land area – which warms faster than oceans – is located in the Northern Hemisphere, so the northern summer coincides with the warmest global average.\nThe Copernicus analyses extend back to 1979. Because of long-term global warming, this July’s record is effectively a record for at least the past century of global observation.\nOther groups that monitor monthly temperature, including NASA and NOAA, will be releasing their findings later in August.\nJuly 2019 was the planet's warmest month on record, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. Among the hottest spots relative to the 1981-2010 average were western Europe, central Asia, Alaska and most of Africa and Australia.\n(Copernicus/WMO)\nMost global heat records are set during or just after El Niño events, which bring warm undersea water to the surface across much of the tropical Pacific, thus warming the atmosphere above.\nThis July’s record is especially striking because it occurred during a weak to marginal El Niño event. In contrast, the July 2016 record occurred at the tail end of one of the strongest El Niño events on record.\nWhile El Niño and La Niña tend to warm and cool the atmosphere for a year or two each, these events are happening on top of longer-term warming related to human-produced greenhouse gases, so the global warm spikes are getting warmer and the cool spikes less cool.\n“We have always lived through hot summers. But this is not the summer of our youth. This is not your grandfather’s summer,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres, commenting last Thursday in New York on the likelihood of a new temperature record from Copernicus.\n“Preventing irreversible climate disruption is the race of our lives, and for our lives. It is a race that we can and must win,” he added.\nThe Copernicus analyses are carried out by the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), which operates weather forecast models and climate prediction models used around the world.\nDifferent analyses of monthly global temperature (such as those from NASA, NOAA and the Japan Meteorological Agency) can result in slightly different rankings, based on how groups account for data-sparse areas.\nThe Copernicus analyses combine global temperature data from surface weather stations with background information from a forecast model that incorporates satellite and other data. The model analysis plays a larger role in regions with few weather stations.\nGlobal Hot Spots in July\nDozens of European cities set new all-time high-temperature records in July, including Paris, France (108.7 degrees); Amsterdam, Netherlands (97.3 degrees); and Helsinki, Finland (91.8 degrees). Five nations saw their hottest temperatures ever recorded:\nBelgium: 107.2 degrees at Begijnendijk, July 25\nGermany: 108.7 degrees at Lingen, July 25\nLuxembourg: 105.4 degrees at Steinsel, July 25\nNetherlands: 105.3 degrees at Gilze Rijen, July 25\nUnited Kingdom: 101.7 degrees at Cambridge, July 25\nAnother part of the world with extreme warmth relative to July norms was Alaska. At least 13 Alaska locations chalked up their hottest month on record, and the state very likely hit such a mark as well, according to climatologist Dr. Brian Brettschneider. The Anchorage airport hit 90 degrees on July 4, breaking its all-time record by 5 degrees, and the city had its warmest month on record by far.\nThe Alaskan heat has coincided with record-low sea-ice extent in the Chukchi Sea to the north, as well as across the entire Arctic.\nJuly was considerably cooler than average over parts of eastern Europe and western Russia. Much of eastern Canada and parts of the south-central U.S. were also cooler than average for July, with a dramatic cool spell in late July setting daily record lows across the South.\nHowever, several cities in New England – including Boston – had their hottest month on record.\nAll-time high-temperature records have been broken this year in 13 of the world’s nations and territories, and tied in another. In contrast, no all-time national cold records have been broken thus far in 2019.\nThe largest number of all-time national/territorial heat records set or tied in a single year was the 22 heat records that occurred in 2016, according to international records researcher Maximiliano Herrera.\nThe runners-up are 2019 and 2017, each with 14 heat records.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line401859"}

The Blues spent over £250million in the summer with the likes of Raheem Sterling, Wesley Fofana, Marc Cucurella and Kalidou Koulibaly all moving to Stamford Bridge.\nSterling has struggled to have the same impact as he did at Manchester City since signing for Chelsea, whilst there is still a need for a capable back-up option for Reece James. James did not make the England World Cup squad after picking up a knee injury in the Blues’ match against AC Milan in October, forcing Cesar Azpilicueta and Ruben Loftus-Cheek having to fill in at right wing- back.\nPotter will be hoping to add players that fit into his style of play in January after inheriting Thomas Tuchel’s squad in September. Denzel Dumfries and Memphis Depay are two players that have been linked with a move to west London and both players have impressed at the World Cup.\nChelsea opted to sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ahead from Barcelona on Deadline Day in the summer instead of Depay, but continue to be linked with the Dutch forward. The 28-year-old wanted to fight for his place at Camp Nou despite their new signings, but with his contract set to expire next summer, he could be available for as little as £5million as per various reports . Dumfries was linked with a move to Stamford Bridge in the summer when Romelu Lukaku sealed a return to Inter Milan on loan, but a deal never materialised for the Dutch defender.\nChelsea may look to go back in for the Netherlands international who is valued at €50million (£42million) by CIES Football Observatory . The 26-year-old plays at right wing-back for both club and country and has registered five goal contributions in 24 appearances so far this season.\nJames’ injury came as a huge blow for the Blues with Potter not having a suitable option to replace him with, meaning a move for Dumfries could strengthen his squad’s depth and quality moving forward and not result in him changing formations when a key player is absent.\nDumfries grabbed the assist for Depay’s goal which saw the Netherlands take the lead against the USA in their World Cup round of 16 tie.

Come for the fun trademark facts, stay for the trailers.\nIn 2014, the Summer box office grossed over $4 billion. The top five grossing movies were:\nX-Men: Days of Future Past\nWhat do all of those movies have in common? Other than digital (and other – ahem) enhancements?\nTrademarks! And lots of them. You see, today’s tentpole movies are as much about brand-building as they are about entertaining. Sure, $100 million at the domestic box office is great, but it is nothing compared to the multipliers big Summer movie’s can experience via merchandising. That is where trademarks play an important role – a fact that is not lost on movie studios. As you will see, attorneys for the major studios have been hard at work pursuing trademark protection for this Summer’s potential blockbusters.\nHere are our top five to keep an eye on:\n1. Avengers: Age of Ultron\nStudio: Marvel (a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company)\nMarvel had two of its movies make it into the top five for the Summer movie box office in 2014. With Avengers: Age of Ultron, it is likely to continue the winning streak. To date, The Avengers is the third highest grossing move of all-time (not adjusting for inflation) with over $1.5 billion on box office receipts. Reports indicate that Marvel (and Disney) stacked up another $1 billion plus in receipts from selling merch related to The Avengers.\nMarvel and Disney, knowing where their bread is buttered, have 11 pending federal trademark applications for AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON. Check out this Variety article if you want a longer read about Marvel’s plans for merchandising Avengers: Age of Ultron.\nMost Viewed Trailer: 70.7 Million views\n2. Tomorrowland\nStudio: Walt Disney Pictures\nThis movie is not about a future where George Clooney is no longer a bachelor. At least, we think.\nEven so, with Clooney involved, you know Disney has high expectations for this film. Disney has had federal protection for the mark TOMORROWLAND since 1970. Who doesn’t remember their first ride on Space Mountain? I didn’t scream once. I swear (Kevin wrote, as he trembled at his computer).\nIn any event, with seven pending applications for the mark MILES FROM TOMORROWLAND, Disney appears prepared in the event Mr. Alamuddin’s movie captures the hearts and minds public.\nMost Viewed Trailer: 9.2 Million views\n3. Jurassic World\nStudio: Ambling Entertainment and Legendary Pictures (in association with) Universal Pictures\nI loved Jurassic Park. It was the highest grossing film of 1993. I say, “Clever girl,” at least once a week. I love Chris Pratt. Last Summer, he led Guardians of the Galaxy to the top of the box office. This movie has the makings of a box office and merchandise juggernaut (Kevin said, pretending certain sequels do not exist). With eight pending federal trademark applications, everyone involved seems to believe that dinosaur-sized dollars are in the future.\nMost Viewed Trailer: 55 Million views\n4. Inside Out\nStudio: Pixar Animation and Walt Disney Studios\nLast Summer, for the first time since 2005, we were deprived of a Pixar release. The last Pixar movie to top the Summer box office was 2010’s Toy Story 3. I am a sucker for Pixar movies and hope that Inside Out is a return to form. Even if it is not, Disney and Pixar certainly have reason to believe that their five pending federal trademark applications are certainly worth their weight in gold. Reports indicate that Disney has made over $10 billion from merchandise based on the Pixar franchise Cars despite the lukewarm reviews both Cars films received.\n5. Minions\nStudio: Illumination Entertainment (Universal)\nThis headline from USA Today, “At Universal, Minions ‘have become our Mickey Mouse,'” says it all. The popular characters from the highly successful Despicable Me franchise are taking center stage this summer, and they have big plans. Despicable Me was the fifth biggest movie of Summer 2010. Despicable Me 2 jumped up two spots to be the third biggest movie of Summer 2013. Minions looks to repeat that feat and become the biggest movie this Summer. If you have learned anything from this post, you already know how valuable the Minions are as a brand. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that there are six pending trademark applications for MINIONS.\nEvery good movie has a moral. The moral of this blog post: Be like a studio executive and protect your trademarks. You never know when one could be worth billions of dollars!\nWritten by Kevin Hartley","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1856816"}

This square is the heart of the French DNA. a 1000 years mille-feuille of History in the making. The headquarter of the old regime, transformed into a monument to the culture, is supposed to represent what French are or at least think they are, and it does quite well:\nCour napoleon, where the Louvre’ s Pyramid sits – credit (11)\nPlace de l’Étoile\nLike for the Louvre, this place is designed to have you overwhelmed by the “grandeur” of the State. The Arc de triomphe built by Napoleon is a monument crowning 500 year of planning of the Royal axis, originating from the Louvre. The hill where it sit on has been leveled, giving it a concave slope, enhancing the overwhelming presence of the Arc, sitting in the middle of a 240 meter diameter round place:\nPlace de l’Étoile is a very large traffic circle. Going to the middle is usually done thru underpass – credit (2)\nÉtoile-Concorde: Champs-Elysées\nEn route from The Louvre (old regime) to the Arc (new regime), it happens to be the Concorde, where the last french king, Louis the XVI has been guillotined. Where French celebrates is on The Champs-Elysées, between the Concorde and Étoile, a vast public space able to contain one million people, with huge plazas, Etoile and the Concorde providing very comfortable overflow, and entry/exit point.\nThe Champs-Elysées on New year Eve (here 2006) looking toward The Concorde – credit (5)\nThe size and topography of the Champs-Elysées help people to appreciate the size of the crowd. The celebration like above suppose to close the 10 lanes of traffic the avenue is normally supporting: A celebration on the Champs-Elysées means not “business as usual”.\nDemonstrating\nRépublique-Bastille-Nation\nDemonstrating is also part of the french DNA, and demonstrating supposes to walk, from one point to another:\nThose points are usually République-Bastille-Nation, in that order!\nDemonstration at Republique – credit (3)\nPlace de la République one of the largest Parisian square is 283x119m is well suited to accommodate large crowds. Beside it, it is not a necessarily inviting place. It is currently under renovation: respecting its history, its current use as a place to vent social message, while making it a more inviting space, especially outside demonstration time, was one of the challenge the contestant had to address. A water mirror, is part of the answer:\nA water Mirror, as seen in Bordeaux, can “activate” large esplanade, while still leave it clear of encumbrance when needed – credit (1)\nPlace de l’Hôtel-de-Ville\nIt is a “people place” per design, and the PPS editors like it [7], but this 155x82meter square is not a self-sufficient one, where people will intuitively go. they will go there only knowing the square is hosting some events, usually sponsored by the City:\nParis- Hôtel-de-Ville is a place for programing; ice rink in winter, beach volley in summer, all sort of fair in between – credit (4)\nA plaza in word, a park in theory, this almost perfect square, is a hit with many urbanistas for good reasons.. like Rome’s Piazza Navona, reaching Place des Vosges requires journeying along minor, often hidden streets. Then away of the crowd and noise of the surrounding city, you find an intimate, secluded, and still comfortable place. The square dimension, 127×140 meters,as well as the building lining help it, contribute to it. It is surrounded by a street allowing a light amount of traffic contributing to a safety feeling at any time any season.\nParis Place des Vosges, the oldest suqare of the city is requiring some effort to be found\nPlace Dauphine dating of the same era work a bit differently- may be too small and carry an oppressive feeling. Place Vendôme, has been designed along the Place des Vosges model (same size), but again it is a colder place. In Paris, Palais Royal, offers almost a similar setting\nPlace George Pompidou\nBetter known as Place Beaubourg, or simply the Piazza, it has been created ex-nihilo by architect Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers and opened in 1977. In despite of its relatively novelty and use of modern architecture in a city full of heritage building, this square works very well at the difference of many other one created in the same period. Due to this, it makes it a very interesting case study:\nIt is facing a Modern art museum known as Beaubourg built at the same time by the same architects. Like Sienna’s Piazza del Campo, the 170x65m square has a slight declivity along its narrow edge, which allow people to appropriate the space like it was a beach: it is not uncommon to see people sitting on the pavement, facing the museum, which happen to have corridors and stairs on its outside facades, offering continuous movement of people to watch from the square.\nLike Place des Vosges, this square is not obvious to find, and offers some respite, step away, of the capharnaum, the Halles can be:\nParis Place George Pompidou, is a successful square created ex nihilo\nAt the difference of Place Des Vosges, this square is fully pedestrian, and is surrounded by cafes and other shops.\nFontaine des Innocents\nPlace Joachim du Bellay is a name very few locals know, but no Parisian ignores its fountain:\nWhen they need to meet, Fontaine(fountain) des Innocents is the natural rendezvous.\nIt is easy to understand why: It is strategically located [10]\nIt is at the cross road of the main Parisian arteries.\nToday, it sits midway between the Parisian subway hub (Châtelet ) and the Regional Express Rail network hub (Les Halles)\nHowever, it is not directly on the way, rather on a “corner” of the intersection, so that the traffic doesn’t pass here. but, more important:\nthe square’s size, 53x80m, is big enough to accommodate a substantiate activity making a good hangout, but small enough to be able to recognize a person in it (see the notion of social field of vision in [9])\nand the square design is perfectly appropriate:\nFontaine des Innocents IS the meeting point in Paris – credit (6)\nThis square is also surrounded by Cafes.\nConcluding\nParis’s Place Stravinsky, a “secondary” but still lovely place – credit (11)\nThis geography is far to be exhaustive, Paris has many other squares, of various size, various features, some more interesting than other… what we have presented are what we see as the “staple” squares of Paris, and we can see some features emerging, noticeably regarding the size of the square:\nDifferent square size are needed in a big city, to accomodate the different function\nAnd still, the square where people feel comfortable to stay, will tend to be in the 120x120meter\nThis size could be not purely arbitrary, and could have to do with our field of vision- we tend to not recognize people beyond this distance and from smaller distance, we tend to be able to describe people facial characteristic – the ~100 meter range lie in between [9].\n[1] flickr user hisgett\n[2] flickr user ar56\n[3] flickr user tofz4u\n[4] flickr user babicka2\n[5] Franck prevel via Le Monde\n[6] Projet Les Halles\n[7] PPS page: Paris’Hotel de Ville (City Hall)\n[8] See for example: Squaring public space with human needs, Lisa Rochon, Globe and mail, Nov 25, 2011.

Since the market has moved away in 1969, the site, having received an underground shopping mall and a subway station seeing close to 1 million passengers a day, has become arguably the biggest urban conundrum of Paris. We gonna study it a bit- This first post layout some general context (at a level allowing me to classified my notes on the topic, so a bit heavier than necessary on the level of historic detail)\nThe geographic context\nThe very center of Paris\nParis with its successive city walls. Les Halles are where the Montmartre road (blue line) meets the Paris \"great cross\" (red lines, the fine lines are the historic route, the thick ones have been layout circa 1850)\nThe centre of Paris is at the center of the “great cross”:\nHistorically, it was defined by rue St Honoré for the west branch, and rue St Denis (doubled by rus St Martin) for the North Branch.\nMostly to resolve traffic issue, This cross will be doubled by the rue de Rivoli (West branch), and Boulevard de Sébastopol (north branch) [8].\nIn 1900 the cross will be doubled by the subway: line 1 for the East West axis, while the line 4 will roughly follow the North-South axis – they are respectively the first and second most used subway lines of the network.\nIn 1977, the opening of the first lines, A and B, of the regional express subway (RER) will also follow this cross…\nThe Montmartre road is coming from of the Montmartre hill following the terrain topography. A historically important road, but not necessarily for commercial reason, at the difference of the great cross roads: the meeting of Montmartre road with the great cross defines Les Halles – historically a triangular shape (between W and NW roads), as most of the medevial square sitting at the crossing of roads, used to be. It is important to note that the Halles has developed exclusively in the NW quadrant of the “active” great cross, basically almost never impeding the traffic on it. It was not the case of Montmartre street, since outside the market activities blocking the street, it was also the site of various celebration, and the pillory was here too:\nLeft: Execution of Aymerigot Marcel, from Froissart's Chronical, Vol.IV, part 1, 1470 - Right: A \"celebration\" at the Halles by Philibert Louis Debucourt - It was to celebrate the birth of the French heir on January 21, 1782.

A history version suggests it was a Jew ghetto – Philippe II Augustus will have expelled them and seized their goods and houses in 1182 [2]-then build two covered market in 1183. They are thought to have been massive enough-100metres long and 10 height, with a vaulted ceiling, all in stones [5]– to have impressed their contemporaries: they will be called “Hala” (halles in french, the English term “hall” is poor translation, and we will keep the french term) and it is the beginning of the story.\nLeft: Halles Champeaux (circa 1183) - right: Halla interior\nAt first the market food trading is marginal. The market will start to flourish then will decline in the 14th and 15th centuries and the halles will fall in ruins. A Francis I reformation ordinance in 1543 will try to correct that. New halles will be erected to extend and replace the old ones circa 1551, that along market organization changes. The emergence of new trading usage (shop…) will make the market focusing increasingly on food trading. Soon enough it will be known as the largest market in Occident.\nHalle a la saline – circa 1784\nLot of things will change around, except 2 landmarks which today are still structuring the site- St Eustache Church and the Innocents Fountain-marked with a “red target” on all the maps to help the reader to contextualize the site:\nLes halles neighborhood, The halles today site and original site. St Eustache church and the Innocents Fountain landmarks highligted\nSt Eustache Church\nIt is a relatively unassuming Gothic style church, with an unfinished and at odd neoclassic frontage [9] – the kind of you can expect in many french cities. Its recognized best profile-highlighting its gothics features slighlty enhanced by some renaissance style details- is seen from its South East side, basically from the Innocents fountain.\nIt is the obvious landmark of the neighborhood. Most of the photographs and paintings of the district include it whenever possible: When you see St Eustache, you know where you are.\nSt Eustache church (in front the \"Prouvaires\" market): 24 barracks built between 1813-1818- circa 1850 (Photo Marville)\nThe Innocents fountain\nEasy to find. On the way, more exactly on the historic Montmartre road axis- between the Halles and the “great cross” intersection- and dominating the middle of an unencumbered and well defined ~80mx60m square: a size big enough to accommodate a substantiate activity making a good hangout, but small enough to be able to recognize a person in it (see the notion of social field of vision in [7]): this unassuming structure is a landmark: it is “THE” meeting spot of the Halles.\nNotice the today square’s name, place Joachim du Bellay, is virtually unknown, overwhelmed it is by the “Innocents” fountain name everyone know.\nSt Innocent fountain, and market. Notice the umbrellas in the forefront, they will play an important role in the Halles history- Photo Marville circa 1855\nA bit of historic background for the Innocents fountain\nInnocents cemetery during the Middle ages\nThe fountain- thought have been existing since 1274 [5][10]– has been a bit peripatetic. Originally this site was a cemetery, the St Innocents cemetery, and the fountain was sitting at the NE corner of it. A cenotaph was sitting in the middle of the cemetery.\nOdours\nThe cemetery- an “overflowing” mass grave-the level was 2meters above natural level [5]– surrounded by an ossuary, has been closed circa 1785 under hygienist concern of the time and pressure of the neighborhood complaining about its “mephitic” odours [6] (the cemetery has been transferred into the catacombs) . The fountain has then replaced the cenotaph. Though merchants was conducting business in the cemetery before its closure, it became the regular market we see in the photo above in 1789-as planned by a 1750s plan.\nProject of conversion of the \"Innocents\" cemetery in a new market dated 1747 or 1767 (notice North is downward)\nbefore be surrounded by shelter for merchant, circa 1811-1813 [2], the Innocent market will receive 400 red parasols in 1800 [5], an anecdote which will eventually have a huge influence on the future of the site. The Innocents market will last up to 1858 when it will be relocated in the Halles Baltard, and give room partially to a park, an opportunity to relocate the fountain for the last time so far.\n\"Innocents\" market by Thomas Naudet circa 1800: 400 parasol had been installed to shelter the merchants (credit wikigallery)\nSome other building of interests\nThe Halle au Blé\nThe Halle au blé with the Médicis Column as it looks today from the Halles (credit wikipedia)\nIn its today form, this building could have eventually been a landmark in a provincial city, but in the Parisian landscape, it looks like another official Parisian building… Its circular and repetitive from makes it a poor orientation helper. The lately added main entrance on its west side, make the building turning its back to the Halles site.\nIt was a building to trade grain and flour. It has been built by Nicolas Le Camus de Mézières between 1763 and 1767, and was part of a larger neighborhood development following a circus layout. This building has been considerably altered in its history to the point it bears little relationship with its original design:\nJacques-Guillaume Legrand and Jacques Molinos added a wooden framed dome in 1782, it will be destroyed by a fire in 1802\nFrançois-Joseph_Bélanger will rebuilt the dome with an iron frame and copper surfacing in 1806-1811\nAfter another fire in 1854, the building will be closed in 1873, and radically transformed by Henri Blondel in 1885, to give its today appearance, and to host a commodity trade market.\nNowadays, it is used by the Paris Chamber of commerce\nOriginal Halle au blé, as designed by Le Camus de Mézières (top). it will receive a wooden roof by Jacques Molinos and Legrand (middle) and will get a dramatic transformation by Blondel giving its today appearance(bottom)\nThe surrounding buildings have followed a similar track.\nrue de Viarmes, circa 1885, left (photo Godefroy)- and now, right (credit wikipedia)\nThe Médicis column\nIt is the column seen next to the Halle au blé building. Commissioned by Catherine de’ Medici in 1574, it predates the building itself, but has always stand still there a bit at odd. Blondel was planning to demolish it in the context of its renovation work: Jean Charles Alphand, to whose Paris owns most of its most celebrated parks, will have intervened against such a fate.\nThe Halle au Draps\nWe mention this building because it was probably the traditional shape of the non food related Halles, and it relates to what have once been one of the most important and flagship trade activities of the medieval halles of Paris: drapery.\nThe illustrated Halles, a 50x400foot building, has been built by Legrand and Molinos in 1786, it will lost its vaulted, wooden framed roof in a fire in 1855. following that, the then almost moribund drapery market, will be transferred to the Halle au ble. The building will be demolished in 1868. The advent of the department stores surrounding the halles, like Le Bon Marché, Samaritaine, the BHV or the Grands magasins du Louvre, will make them the place of choice to buy drapery\nThe \"halle aux draps\" by Nicolle Victor Jean (circa 1830)- Probably a very traditional shape for the non-food \"mortar\" built Halle, it has been demolished in 1868\nThe market in 1850’s\nThe Halles, for the food related market, are largely very medieval in their typology, and the last addition like the Prouvaires market built by Jean-Jacques-Marie Huvé between 1813-1818 (see photo above) or the halles for the fish and butter market, built in 1822 by Hubert Rohault de Fleury, don’t revisit this style, thought they are almost contemporary of the Covent garden market in London.\nIn former time and in addition to Les Halles, Parisian houses in commercial districts had an open ground floor, where market activities was held. this form used to be called “Piliers” (from the building foundation pillars)-they form a 4meters wide gallery on the east side, and a 2meters wide one elsewhere [5], but in fact the market was sprawling in all the surrounding area. The Giuseppe Canella’s canvas below illustrates it:\n\"les halles\" circa 1830 and the Tonnellerie's \"Piliers\" - notice the roof shape of the covered market\nthe market is the largest known central market of its time and live mostly at night: people, including 7162 counted sellers, start to come around 11pm, to serve an estimated 40,000+ customers, and are supposed by bylaw to have freed the street by 9am or 10am (in winter).\nThe market roughly occupies 3.6 hectares -2.2hectares for flower, fruit and vegetable only- partitioned as following:\n1 hectares of Halles (covered market)\n0.6 hectares on open space\n2 hectares on public street\nTraffic is a huge issue- there are counted 4,000 carts occupying an additional 2 hectares. handcart, basket storage, and livestock occupy an additional 0.5 hectares (number above from [11], [12] provides similar numbers, 5.5 hectares for the whole market).\nThe area is a fertile ground for endemic prostitution and other activities associated with more or less shady nightlife [15]. The retail market is functioning all the day, making the area active 24hr a day.\nAdding to the picture the smell of the rotten food (odours have always been a strong marker of the site [15]), it doesn’t necessarily make a desirable place to live, and in fact the neighborhood, “unhealthy, badly built and crowded, is of a repulsive appearance” [14]: It is the “worst” slump of Paris where the living population density level has been reported at up to 100,000 people/km2 [1][15]. Diseases are widespread and the neighborood will be a nest of the 1832 cholera pandemic [13]\nThought there were many men, for packing work- called fort des halles– many of the merchants were women, and the market was associated with a high level of gossiping and obscene language by the moral bourgeoisie of the time [13]. Eventually due to the market sprawl and ensuing disorganization, the government had little control on its activities, market stall allocation, tax collection..etc…. The government will try to get better control on it… It will be the object of another post:\nIn this Marville photo (circa 1855), all the structuring edifices mentioned in this post are appearing. but what is the focus of the photo is the Halles Baltard: it will deserves a post of its own\n[1]The autumn of Central Paris, Anthony Sutcliffe, mc Gill Quueens Univeristy Press, 1970\n[2] Mémoires de la Société de l’histoire de Paris et de l’Île-de-France, Volume 3, Paris, 1876\n[3]it was kind of an European tradition when the government was in need of money.

Andrew has a list of the Microbrewery places in South Australia. They consider Lobethal to be one of the best. Actually I think almost all of the beer manufacturing in South Australia is foreign owned. I liked Lobethal., a quiet place, not very overtly German, like some of the other towns in the area – particularly our next stop. I had a wander around the main street, which for a weekday, was very quiet. I did, of course, find the little white church and took photographs of the 1922 foundation stone. Around the place there were many posts and posters highlighting the benefits of the Lobethal Lutheran School. All this came about in 1838 when George Fife Angas left South Australia to recruit prospective colonist for the new Province in South Australia. A number of Lutherans were anxious to leave the town of Klemzig In Prussia because of persecution by the King of Prussia. They were led by their Pastor, Augusta Ludwig Kavel. They settled in a small parcel of land by the River Torrens which they called Klemzig after the town they had left. Over the years the area has been absorbed into the City of Adelaide. The second wave of German Settlers move further into the interior of the colony and purchased land there. There were a number of settlements of which Lobethal and Hahndorf are\nThe old church bell at the white Church- Lobethal\nbut two. With the anti-German feeling during the World War One, many of the German names were abolished and changed – Lobethal became Tweedvale. Most of the names were changed back by government decree in 1934 all except Petersburg. Petersburg became simply Peterborough. In 1934 when the other towns were allowed to return to their original names, Peterborough decided not to and to remain as it was. Interestingly, the first ever Lutheran Church in Australia was built in Lobethal and the 1641 Bible of Pastor Kavel is kept there. Not too sure about that so I will have to do some searching.\nWe spent some time wandering around Lobethal before heading off to Hahndorf for a late lunch. John had been there before so he chose the place where we would have our meal. We had a quiet walk through the local area before entering the “German Arms Hotel” Hahndorf was one of the areas settled by the German Settlers who became prosperous in the new settlement. The South Australian Wine industry, the largest in Australia had its Genesis here with several German families who realised that the cool climate of the Adelaide Hills was perfect\nThe German Arms\nHahndorf SA\nfor growing grapes and producing wine. There are a large number of Wineries in this area and I am led to understand the the Wolf Blass Gallery and Museum will be built at Hahndorf. Unlike Lobethal, Hahndorf displays its German Heritage in a number of ways, not the least of which is its food and restaurants. Having been here several times, John took me to the German Arms a German Bierhaus and Restaurant. Because of\nthe long drive ahead of us we settled on Lemonade ( boo — hiss) John ordered a Trio of German Wurt with some sauce, -which he said was really good. I was less adventurous and had a Chicken and Prawn Pasta with a really nice cheese sauce. The portions were very large and I was unable to finish my meal. The staff did offer me a take-away box, but I felt it was a long drive and quite warm – too warm to carry in a car for 550 kilometers. Not being a food blogger in any way shape or form, it never really occurred to me to take photographs of our meal. The place was really nice, the staff friendly, the service excellent and it just had a really good atmosphere. I would have liked to have spent a lot more time there.\nLeaving the German Arms carpark John set the Tom Tom for Tea Tree Plaza. I needed to go there to get some things for the\nLobethal: Car park at back of the Bierhaus — not customers.\nchurch before heading home. As I said in the previous post, our drive through to Lobethal and then to Hahndorf was uphill, downhill, narrow roads, sharp twists and turns, well, less than ten minutes after leaving Hahndorf we were on the approach road to the South Eastern Freeway and a short while later at Adelaide. I asked John why we didn’t go that way in the first place, “my way was more adventurous”.

In Vincent v. DeVries, a client and his sister contracted to sell their home for $52,000 to buyers. Shortly before the scheduled closing, the sister died and the client refused to go forward with the sale. The buyers then sued the client seeking specific performance of the contract. The client hired an attorney to defend him in the action.\nInstead of responding to the complaint, the attorney moved for summary judgment. The buyers made their own motion for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The attorney then filed an answer to the complaint and a series of motions seeking relief from the judgment alleging that the client was fraudulently induced into signing the contract. However, the trial court enforced the judgment finding that the client was precluded from raising new legal issues after judgment had entered.\nThe client then terminated the attorney. He eventually entered into a settlement agreement with the buyers, which allowed him to keep his home in exchange for a payment of $103,000, which included the buyers’ attorney’s fees incurred to prosecute the case.

In Aseel v. Jonathan E. Kroll & Assoc., PLLC, a client hired an attorney to represent him in his divorce proceedings. The client subsequently brought a legal malpractice suit against the attorney for negligently representing him in the divorce.\nThe attorney moved to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was barred by a three year statute of limitations. The trial court granted the motion. The client appealed arguing that the statute of limitations was tolled by the continuous representation doctrine, which applies when there is a mutual understanding between the lawyer and client to continue the representation for the matter underlying the malpractice claim.\nThe appellate court affirmed. The client had removed his case file from the attorney’s office without his knowledge, which the court held constituted termination of the attorney-client relationship. Therefore, the case was properly dismissed as time barred because it was commenced more than three years from that date.\nDecision: Aseel v. Jonathan E. Kroll & Assoc., PLLC.doc\nHaddy v.

In a legal malpractice case arising from litigation, in addition to proving that the attorney was negligent, the plaintiff must also prove the “case within the case”. This means that he must show that he would have succeeded in the underlying suit but for the attorney’s negligence.\nHere, the client submitted an affidavit of a medical professional with his opposition to the attorney’s motion for summary judgment, but failed to present expert witness testimony regarding the attorney’s negligence.

In Frasco, Caponigro, Wineman, & Scheible, PLLC v. IGC Management, Inc., a sub-contractor hired an attorney to recover funds from a general contractor. The general contractor later filed for bankruptcy, and a bank was found to have a priority security interest against the contractor’s assets.\nThe attorney, who also represented other unpaid sub-contractors, negotiated a mediated settlement with the financers of the project. However, the original sub-contractor did not assent to the terms of the settlement. The attorney informed the mediator and requested that the agreement contain a separate signature line for the sub-contractor, which the mediator failed to include. Nevertheless, the attorney executed the agreement and the bankruptcy court found that the sub-contractor was bound by its terms because the attorney signed on its behalf.\nThe sub-contractor then sued the attorney for legal malpractice. The attorney moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. The sub-contractor appealed.\nThe appellate court affirmed, finding that although the attorney’s conduct may have breached his ethical duties, it did not constitute malpractice. Under Michigan law, liability for settling a case without a client’s consent stems from a bad faith breach of contract rather than negligence.

Several months later, the client terminated the attorney’s representation.\nNearly three years later, the Commissioner’s office served the attorney with an ex parte motion to dismiss the case for abandonment and a court order granting the motion. The attorney forwarded the filings to the client, and filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. The following month, the client moved to set aside the Order of Abandonment, which the trial court denied because the case had already been dismissed.\nOver one year later, the client filed a legal malpractice claim against the attorney, alleging that he had negligently allowed the previous suit to be dismissed for lack of prosecution. The attorney moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted on the basis that the suit was barred by a one-year statute of limitations on legal malpractice claims.\nThe appellate court affirmed, finding that the statutory period began to run when the attorney informed the client that his case had been dismissed, or, at the latest, the following month when the client moved to set aside the judgment. Under either scenario, the client failed to commence his action within one year of either event. Summary judgment was therefore proper.\nDecision: Lewis v. Album\nVara v. Williams, No. 03-10-00861-CV: Texas Appellate Court Affirms Summary Judgment for Attorney in Legal Malpractice Case\nA Texas appellate court has affirmed a summary judgment in favor of an attorney in a legal malpractice action. In Vara v. Williams, a client hired an attorney to represent her in a divorce proceeding. The parties reached a mediated settlement, and the trial court entered a final divorce decree, which included a provision directing the parties to sign an operating trust agreement (“OTA”) allocating community property assets. Subsequently, disputes arose regarding the OTA, and the client hired a new attorney to represent her in that transaction.\nThe client later filed an action against the first attorney for negligently handling the OTA negotiations and several other causes of action. The attorney moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted on the basis that the client had failed to timely designate an expert witness.\nThe appellate court affirmed, finding that contrary to Texas law, the client had attempted to transform a single count for legal malpractice into several other claims. In failing to timely designate an expert, the client could not succeed on her malpractice claim because she could not prove that the attorney had breached the standard of care. Summary judgment was therefore appropriate.\nBailey v. Robinson, No. 2 CA-CV 2012-0098: Arizona Appellate Court Affirms Summary Judgment for Attorney in Legal Malpractice Case\nAn Arizona appellate court has affirmed summary judgment in favor of an attorney in a legal malpractice action. In Bailey v. Robinson, a taxpayer hired an attorney to represent him in a civil action against the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), seeking a refund from a prior tax year. After a trial in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, the court entered judgment for the IRS. The attorney then withdrew his representation.\nThe client filed a motion seeking relief from the judgment, arguing that an IRS agent had perjured herself and submitted falsified documents at trial. The client also argued that his attorney failed to discover or argue these issues. The trial court denied the motion, specifically ruling that the client failed to show that the agent had lied under oath or presented falsified documents, and therefore identified no reason for the attorney to have inquired into these subjects.\nSeveral years later, the taxpayer sued his former attorney in state court for malpractice, again alleging that the attorney negligently failed to discover the IRS agent’s alleged perjury. The attorney successfully moved for summary judgment and the taxpayer appealed.\nThe appellate court affirmed, finding that the taxpayer was estopped from arguing that the agent perjured herself, because this issue was fully litigated and essential to the District Court’s judgment. Thus, there were no remaining issues of material fact and summary judgment was properly granted.\nDecision: Bailey v. Robinson\nUpdated: March 16, 2013 4:34 pm\nFacchinato v. Gerds, No. 305129: Michigan Appellate Court Affirms Summary Judgment for Attorney in Legal Malpractice Action\nA Michigan appellate court has affirmed a summary judgment in favor of an attorney in a legal malpractice action. In Facchiano v. Gerds.doc, a husband and wife hired an attorney to draft an agreement to transfer a 40% interest in their second home to their daughter. The transaction was completed and the daughter subsequently obtained a mortgage on her interest in the property.\nOver two years later, the daughter defaulted on the loan and filed for bankruptcy. The parents consulted another attorney to investigate their options. The second attorney advised the couple that there was nothing they could do to prevent the lender from foreclosing on the mortgage. However, the attorney did not inform the couple that they might have a negligence claim against the attorney who drafted the agreement.\nAlmost one year later, the parents filed a legal malpractice action against the first attorney. The attorney successfully moved to for summary judgment on the basis that the claim was barred by a statute of limitations. The parents appealed.\nUnder Michigan law, legal malpractice actions must be brought within two years of the act or omission of the attorney, which caused the clients’ damages. The statute is tolled for an additional six months from the date when the clients discovered or should have discovered the alleged injury.\nUpdated: March 3, 2013 8:30 pm","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1341533"}

The compound vanadium pentoxide has grabbed the spotlight as a way to improve lithium-ion batteries. However, it’s less-than-stellar behavior has been problematic.\nAn international team working at the Molecular Foundry (Berkeley) revealed why the material may not perform as expected. The team discovered how interactions between electrons and ions slow the performance of electrodes made with vanadium pentoxide (Nature Communications, “Mapping polaronic states and lithiation gradients in individual V2O5 nanowires”).\nThis work answers, in part, why the material gets bogged down. Vanadium pentoxide’s layered atomic structure results in a vast surface area, but a bottleneck occurs. If scientists can address the bottleneck, this material may lead to the next generation of batteries, which pack more punch, last longer, and charge or discharge more quickly.\nA scanning electron microscopy image of vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The inset shows a ball-and-stick model of vanadium pentoxide’s atomic structure before and after inserting lithium ions (green). (Image: Texas A&M University)\nAn international team of scientists working at the Molecular Foundry has revealed how interactions between electrons and ions can slow down the performance of vanadium pentoxide, a material considered key to the next generation of batteries.\nThe compound vanadium pentoxide has grabbed the spotlight as a potential nanostructured material for state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries because it can provide a greater surface area for the arrival and insertion of lithium ions. That quality makes vanadium pentoxide a good candidate as a cathode, the part of a battery where electrons and lithium ions enter.\nThe speed with which electrons can enter and exit the cathode determines how much power the battery can provide. The entry and exit speed also determine how quickly a battery recharges.\nPower density and charging are both critical factors in the world of mobile electronics or electrification of our automotive fleet. But despite vanadium pentoxide’s potential, it has yet to be widely adopted commercially because of its less-than-stellar performance when put to the test in the real world.\nThe new findings shed light on the slowdown. The results show that the flow of electrons in vanadium pentoxide nanowires gets bogged down as it interacts with lithium ions in a phenomenon known as small polaron formation.\nThe research group, which involved scientists at Texas A&M University, made 2D maps of the electronic properties of synthesized vanadium pentoxide nanowires serving as a model lithium-ion cathode using scanning transmission x-ray microscopy at the Canadian Light Source. They came to the Molecular Foundry to interpret their findings.\nSource: Molecular Foundry, Berkeley Lab\nVanadium Redox Flow Batteries for Large Scale Energy Storage\nLithium batteries may reign supreme when it comes to cellphones, laptops and electric vehicles.

(© ACS)\nLithium-oxygen systems could someday outperform today’s lithium-ion batteries because of their potential for high energy density. However, a number of important issues, such as their poor electrochemical stability must be addressed before these systems can successfully compete with current rechargeable batteries.Today, in ACS Central Science (“Nanoengineered Ultralight and Robust All-Metal Cathode for High-Capacity, Stable Lithium–Oxygen Batteries”), researchers report a new type of cathode, which could make lithium-oxygen batteries a practical option.\nXin-Bo Zhang and colleagues note that most of the problems associated with lithium-oxygen battery systems arise from two highly reduced oxygen species that react readily with the electrolyte and the cathode. Carbon is a common strong-performing cathode, but it is unstable in these systems.\nThe successful development of Li–O2 battery technology depends on resolving the issue of cathode corrosion by the discharge product (Li2O2) and/or by the intermediates (LiO2) generated during cell cycling. As an important step toward this goal, we report for the first time the nanoporous Ni with a nanoengineered AuNi alloy surface directly attached to Ni foam as a new all-metal cathode system.\nSo, the team hypothesized that the key to unlocking lithium-oxygen batteries’ potential could be to create cathodes that are unreactive to the reduced oxygen species, but that still have the same highly conductive, low-weight, porous characteristics of carbon cathodes. The researchers succeeded in creating an ultralight all-metal cathode.\nThe design incorporated three forms of nickel including a nanoporous nickel interior and a gold-nickel alloy surface directly attached to nickel foam. Compared to carbon cathodes, the system has much higher capacity and is stable for 286 cycles, which is amongst the best for lithium-oxygen systems, and is nearly competitive with current commercial lithium-ion systems.\nFurther experimentation showed that the stability and performance arise from both the metal used and its nanoporous structure, and that both these aspects could be optimized to further improve performance.\nJi-Jing Xu, Zhi-Wen Chang, Yan-Bin Yin, and Xin-Bo Zhang*\nState Key Laboratory of Rare Earth Resources Utilization, Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun 130022, P.

The zinc batteries could be used to power everything from wearable sensors to solar cells and other kinds of electronics.\nThe work appears in the April 19, 2017 issue of Advanced Energy Materials.\nThe researchers made the printed batteries flexible and stretchable by incorporating a hyper-elastic polymer material made from isoprene, one of the main ingredients in rubber, and polystyrene, a resin-like component. The substance, known as SIS, allows the batteries to stretch to twice their size, in any direction, without suffering damage.\nThe ink used to print the batteries is made of zinc silver oxide mixed with SIS. While zinc batteries have been in use for a long time, they are typically non-rechargeable. The researchers added bismuth oxide to the batteries to make them rechargeable.\n“This is a significant step toward self-powered stretchable electronics,” said Joseph Wang, one of the paper’s senior authors and a nanoengineering professor at the Jacobs School of Engineering at UC San Diego, where he directs the school’s Center for Wearable Sensors. “We expect this technology to pave the way to enhance other forms of energy storage and printable, stretchable electronics, not just for zinc-based batteries but also for Lithium-ion batteries, as well as supercapacitors and photovoltaic cells.”\nThe prototype battery the researchers developed has about 1/5 the capacity of a rechargeable hearing aid battery. But it is 1/10 as thick, cheaper and uses commercially available materials. It takes two of these batteries to power a 3 Volt LED. The researchers are still working to improve the battery’s performance. Next steps include expanding the use of the technology to different applications, such as solar and fuel cells; and using the battery to power different kinds of electronic devices.\nResearchers used standard screen printing techniques to make the batteries–a method that dramatically drives down the costs of the technology. Typical materials for one battery cost only $0.50. A comparable commercially available rechargeable battery costs $5.00 Batteries can be printed directly on fabric or on materials that allow wearables to adhere to the skin. They also can be printed as a strip, to power a device that needs more energy. They are stable and can be worn for a long period of time.\nMaking the batteries rechargeable\nThe key ingredient that makes the batteries rechargeable is a molecule called bismuth oxide which, when mixed into the batteries’ zinc electrodes, prolongs the life of devices and allows them to recharge. Adding bismuth oxide to zinc batteries is standard practice in industry to improve performance, but until recently, there hasn’t been a thorough scientific explanation for why.\nLast year, UC San Diego nanoengineers led by Professor Y. Shirley Meng published a detailed molecular study addressing this question (download PDF here). When zinc batteries discharge, their electrodes react with the liquid electrolyte inside the battery, producing zinc salts that dissolve into a solution. This eventually short circuits the battery. Adding bismuth oxide keeps the electrode from losing zinc to the electrolyte. This ensures that the batteries continue to work and can be recharged.\nThe work shows that it is possible to use small amounts of additives, such as bismuth oxide, to change the properties of materials. “Understanding the scientific mechanism to do this will allow us to turn non-rechargeable batteries into rechargeable batteries—not just zinc batteries but also for other electro-chemistries, such as Lithium-oxygen,” said Meng, who directs the Sustainable Power and Energy Center at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering\nFrom Innovation to Market\nRajan Kumar, a co-first author on this Advanced Energy Materials paper, is a nanoengineering Ph.D. student at the Jacobs School of Engineering. He and nanoengineering professor Wang are leading a team focused on commercializing aspects of this work. The team is one of five to be selected to join a new technology accelerator at UC San Diego. The technology accelerator is run by the UC San Diego Institute for the Global Entrepreneur, which is a collaboration between the Jacobs School of Engineering and Rady School of Management.\nKumar is excited at the prospect of taking advantage of all that the IGE Technology Accelerator has to offer.\n“For us, it’s strategically perfect,” said Kumar, referring to the $50,000 funding for prototype improvements, the focus on prototype testing with a strategic partner, and the entrepreneurship mentoring.\nKumar is confident in the team’s innovations, which includes the ability to replace coin batteries with thin, stretchable batteries. Making the right strategic moves now is critical for commercialization success.\n“It’s now about making sure our energies are focused in the right direction,” said Kumar.\nIn addition to the IGE Technology Accelerator, the team was also recently selected to participate in the NSF Innovation-Corps (I-Corps) program at UC San Diego, also administered by the Institute for the Global Entrepreneur. One of the key tenets of the I-Corps program is helping startup teams validate their target markets and business models early in the commercialization process. Through NSF I-Corps, for example, Kumar has already started interviewing potential customers which has helped the team better focus their commercialization strategy.\nThrough these programs, Kumar is focused on leading the team through a series of milestones in order to best position their innovations to refine “both what to build and who to build it for,” he said.\nPaper Citation\n“All-Printed, Stretchable Zn-Ag2O Rechargeable Battery via Hyperelastic Binder for Self-Powering Wearable Electronics” in the journal Advanced Energy Materials.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aenm.201602096/full\nAuthors: Rajan Kumar, Jaewook Shin, Lu Yin, Jung-Min You, Prof. Shirley Meng and Prof. Joseph Wang, Department of Nanoengineering, Jacobs School of Engineering, University of California San Diego.\nJoseph Wang is a distinguished professor, holds the SAIC endowed chair, and serves as chair of the Department of NanoEngineering at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering where he directs the Center for Wearable Sensors.\nShirley Meng is a professor in the Department of NanoEngineering and Director of the Sustainable Power and Energy Center at the UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering.\nResearch funders include: Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (DE-AR0000535); Rajan Kumar acknowledges the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship under Grant No (DGE-1144086).\nThis work was performed in part at the San Diego Nanotechnology Infrastructure (SDNI), a member of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure, which is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF).\nLeave a comment Posted in Nanotechnology Tagged Batteries, Genesis Nanotechnology, Printable Batteries, Sensors, UC San Diego, Wearable Electronics\nMIT: A BIG step toward mass-producible quantum computers\nA team of researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and Sandia National Laboratories reports a new technique for creating targeted defects in diamond materials, which is simpler and more precise than its predecessors and could benefit diamond-based quantum computing devices.\nQuantum computers are experimental devices that offer large speedups on some computational problems. One promising approach to building them involves harnessing nanometer-scale atomic defects in diamond materials.But practical, diamond-based quantum computing devices will require the ability to position those defects at precise locations in complex diamond structures, where the defects can function as qubits, the basic units of information in quantum computing. In Nature Communications (“Scalable focused ion beam creation of nearly lifetime-limited single quantum emitters in diamond nanostructures”), a team of researchers from MIT, Harvard University, and Sandia National Laboratories reports a new technique for creating targeted defects, which is simpler and more precise than its predecessors.\nIn experiments, the defects produced by the technique were, on average, within 50 nanometers of their ideal locations.\n“The dream scenario in quantum information processing is to make an optical circuit to shuttle photonic qubits and then position a quantum memory wherever you need it,” says Dirk Englund, an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science who led the MIT team. “We’re almost there with this. These emitters are almost perfect.”\nThe new paper has 15 co-authors. Seven are from MIT, including Englund and first author Tim Schröder, who was a postdoc in Englund’s lab when the work was done and is now an assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute. Edward Bielejec led the Sandia team, and physics professor Mikhail Lukin led the Harvard team.\nAppealing defects\nQuantum computers, which are still largely hypothetical, exploit the phenomenon of quantum “superposition,” or the counterintuitive ability of small particles to inhabit contradictory physical states at the same time. An electron, for instance, can be said to be in more than one location simultaneously, or to have both of two opposed magnetic orientations.\nWhere a bit in a conventional computer can represent zero or one, a “qubit,” or quantum bit, can represent zero, one, or both at the same time. It’s the ability of strings of qubits to, in some sense, simultaneously explore multiple solutions to a problem that promises computational speedups.\nDiamond-defect qubits result from the combination of “vacancies,” which are locations in the diamond’s crystal lattice where there should be a carbon atom but there isn’t one, and “dopants,” which are atoms of materials other than carbon that have found their way into the lattice. Together, the dopant and the vacancy create a dopant-vacancy “center,” which has free electrons associated with it. The electrons’ magnetic orientation, or “spin,” which can be in superposition, constitutes the qubit.\nA perennial problem in the design of quantum computers is how to read information out of qubits. Diamond defects present a simple solution, because they are natural light emitters. In fact, the light particles emitted by diamond defects can preserve the superposition of the qubits, so they could move quantum information between quantum computing devices.\nSilicon switch\nThe most-studied diamond defect is the nitrogen-vacancy center, which can maintain superposition longer than any other candidate qubit. But it emits light in a relatively broad spectrum of frequencies, which can lead to inaccuracies in the measurements on which quantum computing relies.\nIn their new paper, the MIT, Harvard, and Sandia researchers instead use silicon-vacancy centers, which emit light in a very narrow band of frequencies. They don’t naturally maintain superposition as well, but theory suggests that cooling them down to temperatures in the millikelvin range — fractions of a degree above absolute zero — could solve that problem. (Nitrogen-vacancy-center qubits require cooling to a relatively balmy 4 kelvins.)\nTo be readable, however, the signals from light-emitting qubits have to be amplified, and it has to be possible to direct them and recombine them to perform computations. That’s why the ability to precisely locate defects is important: It’s easier to etch optical circuits into a diamond and then insert the defects in the right places than to create defects at random and then try to construct optical circuits around them.\nIn the process described in the new paper, the MIT and Harvard researchers first planed a synthetic diamond down until it was only 200 nanometers thick. Then they etched optical cavities into the diamond’s surface. These increase the brightness of the light emitted by the defects (while shortening the emission times).\nThen they sent the diamond to the Sandia team, who have customized a commercial device called the Nano-Implanter to eject streams of silicon ions. The Sandia researchers fired 20 to 30 silicon ions into each of the optical cavities in the diamond and sent it back to Cambridge.\nMobile vacancies\nAt this point, only about 2 percent of the cavities had associated silicon-vacancy centers. But the MIT and Harvard researchers have also developed processes for blasting the diamond with beams of electrons to produce more vacancies, and then heating the diamond to about 1,000 degrees Celsius, which causes the vacancies to move around the crystal lattice so they can bond with silicon atoms.\nAfter the researchers had subjected the diamond to these two processes, the yield had increased tenfold, to 20 percent. In principle, repetitions of the processes should increase the yield of silicon vacancy centers still further.\nWhen the researchers analyzed the locations of the silicon-vacancy centers, they found that they were within about 50 nanometers of their optimal positions at the edge of the cavity. That translated to emitted light that was about 85 to 90 percent as bright as it could be, which is still very good.\nSource: By Larry Hardesty, MIT\nLeave a comment Posted in Nanotechnology Tagged MIT, Nanomaterials, Nanotechnology, Quantum Computing\nWater is surprisingly ordered on the nanoscale\nNanometric-sized water drops are everywhere – in the air as droplets or aerosols, in our bodies as medication, and in the earth, within rocks and oil fields. To understand the behavior of these drops, it is necessary to know how they interact with their hydrophobic environment.\nThis interaction takes places at the curved droplet interface, a sub-nanometric region that surrounds the small pocket of water. Researchers from EPFL, in collaboration with the institute AMOLF in the Netherlands, were able to observe what was going on in this particular region.\nThey discovered that molecules on the surface of the drops were much more ordered than expected. Their surprising results have been published in Nature\nCommunications. They pave the way to a better understanding of atmospheric, biological and geological processes.\nUnique perspective on miniscule droplets\nAt EPFL, Sylvie Roke, director of the Julia Jacobi Chair of Photomedicine -Laboratory for Fundamental BioPhotonics, has developed a unique method for examining the surface of these droplets that are as thick as one thousandth of a hair, with a volume of an attoliter (18 zeros behind the comma).\n“The method involves overlapping ultrashort laser pulses in a mixture of water droplets in liquid oil and detecting photons that are scattered only from the interface”, explains Roke. “These photons have the sum frequency of the incoming photons and are thus of a different color. With this newly generated color we can know the structure of the only the interface.”\nHydrogen bonding as strong as in ice\nThe surface of the water droplets turns out to be much more ordered than that of normal water and is comparable to super cooled (liquid < 0 °C water) water in which the water molecules have very strong hydrogen bond interactions. In ice, these interactions lead to a stable tetrahedral surrounding of each water molecule. Surprisingly, this type of structure was found on the surface of the droplets even at the room temperature – 50 °C above were it would normally appear.\nThis research provides valuable insight into the properties of nanometric water drops. “The chemical properties of these drops depend on how the water molecules are organized on the surface, so it’s really important to understand what’s going on there,” explained Roke. Further research could target the surface properties of water droplets with adding salt, a more realistic model of marine aerosols that consist of salty water surrounded by a hydrophobic environment. Salt may either enhance the water network or reduce its strength. “Or, it may not do anything at all. Given the surprising results found here, we can only speculate”, says Roke.\nThe surface of the water droplets turns out to be much more ordered than that of normal water and is comparable to super cooled (liquid < 0 °C water) water in which the water molecules have very strong hydrogen bond interactions. @ EPFL- Julia Jacobi Chair of Photomedicine – Laboratory for fundamental BioPhotonics\nThe interfacial structure of water droplets in a hydrophobic liquid\nNikolay Smolentsev, Wilbert J.

The Lilium Jet successfully completed its maiden test flight series in the skies above Bavaria. The 2-seater Eagle prototype executed a range of complex maneuvers, including its signature mid-air transition from hover mode to wing-borne forward flight.\nSeeing the Lilium Jet take to the sky and performing sophisticated maneuvers with apparent ease is testament to the skill and perseverance of our amazing team. We have solved some of the toughest engineering challenges in aviation to get to this point. The successful test flight programme shows that our ground-breaking technical design works exactly as we envisioned. We can now turn our focus to designing a 5-seater production aircraft.\nLilium enables you to travel 5 times faster than a car by introducing the world’s first all-electric vertical take-off and landing jet: an air taxi for up to 5 people. You won’t have to own one, you will simply pay per ride and call it with a push of a button. It’s our mission to make air taxis available to everyone and as affordable as riding a car.\nIn 1894, Otto Lilienthal began experimenting with the first gliders and imagined a future in which we could all fly wherever we want, whenever we want.

Tesla’s latest vehicle, the Model S 100D has a 100-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which reportedly gives it a range of 335 miles (540 km).\nThe pack is large, about 16 feet long, 6 feet wide and 4 inches thick. It contains more than 8,000 lithium-ion battery cells, each one individually packaged inside a cylinder housing that measures about 2 to 3 inches (6 to 7 centimeters) high and about 0.8 inches (2 cm) across.\n“We thought if we could use the same space as the battery in the Tesla, but improve the energy density and finally drive 1,000 km, this would be nice,” Wolter told Live Science.\nOne way of doing this would be to refine the materials inside the battery so that it could store more energy, she said. But another way would be to improve the system’s design as a whole, Wolter said.\nNearly 50 percent of each cell is devoted to components such as the housing, the anode (the battery’s negative terminal), the cathode (the battery’s positive terminal) and the electrolyte, the liquid that transports the charged particles.\nAdditional space is needed inside the car to wire the battery packs to the vehicle’s electrical system.\n“It’s a lot of wasted space,” Wolter said. “You have a lot of inactive components in the system, and that’s a problem from our point of view.”\nThe scientists decided to reimagine the entire design, they said.\nAn illustration that shows how the new electric battery is stacked like a ream of paper. Credit: Fraunhofer IKTS\nTo do so, they got rid of the housings that encase individual batteries and turned to a thin, sheet-like design instead of a cylinder.\nTheir metallic sheet is coated with an energy-storage material made from powdered ceramic mixed with a polymer binder. One side serves as the cathode, and other side serves as the anode.\nThe researchers stacked several of these so-called bipolar electrodes one on top of the other, like sheets of paper in a ream, separating the electrodes by thin layers of electrolyte and a material that prevents electrical charges from shorting out the whole system.\nThe “ream” is sealed within a package measuring about 10 square feet (1square meter), and contacts on the top and bottom connect to the car’s electrical system.\nThe goal is to build a battery system that fits in the same space as the one used by Tesla’s vehicles or other electric vehicles, the researchers said.\n“We can put more electrodes storing the energy in the same space,” Wolter said.\nShe added that the researchers aim to have such a system ready to test in cars by 2020.\nOriginal article on Live Science.\nLeave a comment Posted in Nanotechnology Tagged Batteries, Energy, EV's, Genesis Nanotechnology, Live Science, Nanotechnology\nMIT: Tesla Not the Only Battery Game in Town ~ Electric Cars Could Be Cheaper Than Internal Combustion by 2030\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel visits Accumotive’s plant in Kamenz, Germany.\nTesla gets the headlines, but big battery factories are being built all over the world, driving down prices.\nBattery production is booming, and Tesla is far from the only game in town.\nAccording to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, global battery production is forecast to more than double between now and 2021. The expansion is in turn driving prices down, good news both for the budding electric-car industry and for energy companies looking to build out grid-scale storage to back up renewable forms of energy.\nWhile Tesla gets tons of attention for its “gigafactories”—one in Nevada that will produce batteries, and another in New York that will produce solar panels—the fact is, the company has a lot of battery-building competition.\nExhibit A is a new battery plant in Kamenz, Germany, run by Accumotive. The half-billion-euro facility broke ground on Monday with a visit from German chancellor Angela Merkel and will supply batteries to its parent company, Daimler, which is betting heavily on the burgeoning electric-vehicle market.\nBut the lion’s share of growth is expected to be in Asia. BYD, Samsung, LG, and Panasonic (which has partnered with Tesla) are all among the world’s top battery producers, and nine of the world’s largest new battery factories are under construction in China (paywall), according to Benchmark Minerals.\nThat competition means the steady downward trend in battery prices is going to continue. On a per-kilowatt-hour basis, costs have fallen from $542 in 2012 to around $139 today, according to analysis by Benchmark.\nThat makes for a huge difference in the cost of an electric car, of which 40 percent is usually down to the battery itself.\nBloomberg’s analysts have already said that the 2020s could be the decade in which electric cars take off—and one even went so far as to say that by 2030, electric cars could be cheaper than those powered by internal combustion.\nThose watching the industry might worry that a flood of cheap batteries could end up hurting profitability for producers, as happened in the solar-panel business.\nThat could happen, but India and China, two huge rising automotive markets, are bullish about using electric cars to help solve problems like traffic congestion and air pollution. So even as supply ramps up, there is likely to be plenty of demand to go around.\nMIT Technology Review: M.

Credit: University of Manchester\nA team of researchers affiliated with institutions in the U.S., China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has developed a new type of porous graphene electrode framework that is capable of highly efficient charge delivery. In their paper published in the journal Science, the group describes how they overcame traditional conflicts arising between trade-offs involving density and speed to produce an electrode capable of facilitating rapid ion transport. Hui-Ming Cheng and Feng Li with the Chinese Academy of Sciences offer a Perspective piece on the work done by the team in the same journal issue, and include some opinions of their own regarding where such work is likely heading.\nIn a perfect world, batteries would have unlimited energy storage delivered at speeds high enough to power devices with unlimited needs. The phaser from Star Trek, for example, would require far more power and speed than is possible in today’s devices.\nWhile it is unlikely that such technology will ever come about, it does appear possible that batteries of the future will perform much better than today, likely due to nano-structured materials—they have already shown promise when used as electrode material due to their unique properties. Unfortunately, their use has been limited thus far due to the ultra-thin nature of the resulting electrodes and their extremely low mass loadings compared to those currently in use. In this new effort, the researchers report on a new way to create an electrode using graphene that overcomes such limitations.\nThe electrode they built is porous, which in this case means that it has holes in it. Those holes, as Cheng and Li note, allow better charge transport while also offering improved capacity retention density. The graphene framework they built, they note, offers a superior means of electron transport and its porous nature allows for a high ion diffusion rate—the holes force the ions to take shortcuts, reducing diffusion.\nCheng and Li suggest the new work is likely to inspire similar designs in the search for better electrode materials, which they further suggest appears likely to lead to new electrodes that are not only practical, but have high mass loadings.\nExplore further: New graphene framework bridges gap between traditional capacitors, batteries\nMore information: Hongtao Sun et al. Three-dimensional holey-graphene/niobia composite architectures for ultrahigh-rate energy storage, Science (2017). DOI: 10.1126/science.aam5852\nNanostructured materials have shown extraordinary promise for electrochemical energy storage but are usually limited to electrodes with rather low mass loading (~1 milligram per square centimeter) because of the increasing ion diffusion limitations in thicker electrodes.\nWe report the design of a three-dimensional (3D) holey-graphene/niobia (Nb2O5) composite for ultrahigh-rate energy storage at practical levels of mass loading (>10 milligrams per square centimeter). The highly interconnected graphene network in the 3D architecture provides excellent electron transport properties, and its hierarchical porous structure facilitates rapid ion transport.\nBy systematically tailoring the porosity in the holey graphene backbone, charge transport in the composite architecture is optimized to deliver high areal capacity and high-rate capability at high mass loading, which represents a critical step forward toward practical applications.\nJournal reference: Science\nLeave a comment Posted in Nanotechnology Tagged Batteries, Energy storage, Genesis Nanotechnology, Graphene, Nano Batteries, University of Manchester","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line464053"}

His palms touch, close to his chest, and his fingers point upwards. His brightly-coloured turban is in stark contrast to his thick white beard. “Namaste,” he says with a slight bow. Literally translated, the word means “I bow to the divine in you.” A respectful greeting, namaste, or namaskar, combined with the wordless hand gesture, conveys the same meaning of acknowledgement for a loved one, a guest or a stranger, regardless of the speaker’s language, culture or religion. Amidst the potpourri of more than 1,500 languages spoken in India, namaste is a universal form of salutation, understood by all, and particularly so during the Kumbh Mela. The left-to-right head wobble – would that be a yes or a no? – is another story!\nSadhus come from all over India to participate in the Kumbh Mela, held every 12 years in Ujjain (Image © Gunther Deichmann)\nIt is a Sensory Overload\nIndia is not for the faint-hearted. It is sensory overload; there are no grey areas: either you’ll love to travel the country or hate it well enough to take the first flight out. India can break you with its poverty, lack of privacy and dirt; ironically, Western travellers claim to have found inner spirituality after a two-week trip. The Kumbh Mela – the largest spiritual gathering in the world, when Hindus gather en masse to bathe in a sacred river and cleanse themselves of sin – is the ultimate test.\nFirst documented by a Chinese traveller in the seventh century, the colourful celebration of the world’s oldest religion is held once every 12 years. The exact date of the festival is determined according to a combination of the zodiac positions of Jupiter, the sun and the moon.\nHindu mythology describes how the Lord Vishnu dropped the drink of immortality over four locations as he was transporting it in a kumbha (pot), hence the name. The Mela (gathering) is centred at the banks of a river where devotees bathe to cleanse themselves of their sins. The main festival site is, of course, located on the banks of a river: the Ganges at Haridwar; the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna and the invisible Sarasvati at Allahabad; the Sarasvati at Allahabad; the Godavari at Nashik; and the Shipra at Ujjain.\nA group of priests performing agni puja, in which a dedication is made to Lord Shiva (Image © Gunther Deichmann)\nThe Kumbh Mela is a melting pot of the millions of people that visit from the various states who, despite speaking diversely different languages, converge peacefully in the name of religion. The event is widely known by its Sanskrit name, Kumbha, the sacred language of Hinduism and a ceremonial language in pujas (prayers) and religious rituals. Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism and one of the oldest Indo-European languages in the world. The literature holds a deep tradition in drama, poetry, religious and philosophical texts.\nAs such, Sanskrit hymns and chants are widely heard throughout the Kumbh Mela. Kumbha is also – fittingly – the sign of the Aquarius.\nThe Kumbh Mela in Ujjain can be traced back to the 18th century. The ancient city, considered one of the most sacred places in India, sits along the eastern bank of the Kshipra River and is located in the state of Madhya Pradesh in central India. It is as if time has stood still here. Visitors travel to India on planes, trains and automobiles, then transfer to more eclectic, old-world modes of transportation: camels, horses, even elephants. The devotees are from all walks of life, from various castes and religious orders – Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, even Christian missionaries – with one purpose: to bathe and be born again, freed into an eternal life without sin and suffering. Between 22 April and 21 May 2016, approximately 75 million people visited.\nThe main temple of reverence in Ujjain is the Mahakaleshwar Jyotirlinga, situated on the side of the Rudra Sagar Lake. It is one of the most famous Hindu temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, and is said to be one of twelve jyotirlingams that is the most sacred abode of Lord Shiva. The Ram Ghat – one of the most popular – is located close to the Harsiddhi Temple in Ujjain. Indian astronomers have calculated that the Tropic of Cancer passes through the city of Ujjain, making it the Greenwich of India.\nThe Peoples\nThe largest crowd-pullers at the Kumbh Mela are the sadhus or the holy men of India. The root word sadh in Sanskrit means ‘to reach one’s goal’; the same word is used in the sadhana, or spiritual practice. Becoming a sadhu is the fourth stage in a Hindu’s life, and the practice is also open to women (sadvi). Coming from a variety of castes, the holy people of India practise a nomadic life and their spiritual discipline involves self-denial: renouncing the world for meditation and contemplation.\nLiving apart from society – in Hindu temples, ashrams, forests and caves – the sadhus focus on their yogic and spiritual beliefs. Some of them thrive in large communes while others choose a more reclusive lifestyle. They rely on donations from people to survive. It is a difficult path and sadhus are considered legally dead unto themselves and to India. Regardless, it is believed that their devotion is good karma and beneficial to Indian society.\nThe nanga (naked) sadhus, with their thick dreadlocks and ash-covered skin, claim to be in the company of ghosts. They certainly look the part. India has an infinite amount of rituals and traditions that can lead one to God. Their choice to live in cemeteries as part of their holy path is, however, macabre. Some are thought to possess special powers. The fascination with the Lord Shiva explains their heavy use of charas (cannabis), who was thought to have a deep affinity for the plant.\nMost devotees at the event are draped in brightly-coloured fabrics, though marigold is predominant, and beads of different shapes and sizes, often mixed with silver, adorn their necks and wrists. Tents of various hues fill the horizon. Fragrant food stalls serve only vegetarian cuisine so that nobody is offended. The smell of musky incense mixed with ganja (marijuana) fills the air. The stairs leading down to the body of water are full of people patiently waiting their turn in the river. The nanga sadhus flock to bathe, proving that one can detach from worldly things. The outcome is an overwhelming, unexpected and extraordinary visual feast.\nEvery 144 years, a Maha (great) Kumbh Mela occurs. It is said that in 2013, more than 120 million pilgrims attended the Maha Kumbh Mela in Allahabad within a span of two months. The gathering was so huge that it was visible from space!\nWhatever the reasons for the pilgrimage, the Kumbh Mela has proven for centuries that it embodies the Indian spirit. From this whirlwind of activities and swirl of languages and cultures, faith – together with the timeless journey towards forgiveness and redemption – is the one factor that unites people.\nFor more stories and photographs from this issue, check out Asian Geographic Issue 120.\nGunther Deichmann\nShirin Bhandari\nPrevious articleThe Future of Language\nNext articleRevisiting the Samurai\nOur Planet, Our Life: Cleaning Up Versova Beach\nNature’s Lightning Show\nEducation and Hope: Inheriting a Future\nThe Sky is Bad Today\nHomeless, not Shameless\nRiding the Golden Eagle: From Russia with Love\nIsland Nations of Asia\nArticles editor - May 3, 2021\nWhat is an Island Nation?

In fact, the large export market share gains of China in low-tech, low-skill products, like textiles, clothing, footwear, and electric appliances, were accompanied by losses in the export shares of several other countries, like Portugal. These indirect effects of competition in third-country export markets are the main object of this study; they can be significant given the growing sophistication of China’s exports, implying greater competition in virtually all industries in which developed economies operate. In our work, we analyze both the direct and indirect labour market effects of rising international trade exposure to China, focusing on the case of Portugal.\nConsistent with previous research, we find evidence that China’s expanding role in global trade represented a major negative shock for the Portuguese labour market. However, in contrast to evidence from other countries, the direct effects of increased imports from China are mostly non-significant. The negative labour market effects stem exclusively from the higher competition of Chinese products in the main destination markets of Portuguese exports. Portuguese workers in industries more exposed to this indirect competition from China saw their total cumulative wages and employment fall when compared to similar workers in less exposed industries. Particular groups of workers were more affected by the Chinese competition in international markets, namely women, older and less educated workers. The paper points to the relevance of differentiating the effects of trade on the cross section of workers when designing economic and social policies aimed at supporting workers hurt by globalization.\nClick here to go to the paper by Sónia Cabral, Pedro S.

Usually, people will mention The Great Gatsby or The Catcher in the Rye. Sometimes Ethan Frome comes up (deservedly so, it’s one of Wharton’s weakest works). Weirdly, people always bring up Moby-Dick, to which my response is, “What high schools are teaching Moby-Dick? Even most colleges don’t teach it anymore.”\nInevitably these exchanges become heated, as people leap in to defend “classic literature” and the general concept of “reading the Classics.” Sometimes passions really flare, and I have a number of writer-acquaintances who will, in private, shake their heads at these threads and talk about cancel culture and censorship and how you’re not allowed to think improper thoughts anymore.\nThe whole phenomenon is of particular interest to me for two reasons. The first is that I adore the Classics, and my extensive reading is a major part of my personal identity, so I always have to restrain myself from weighing in.\nAnd the second is that I never did the reading in high school. The last book I remember opening for high school English was Pride and Prejudice in 10th grade, and it was so dull that I threw it across the room and finished my essay using CliffsNotes. For most of college, and even grad school, I didn’t read any of the required texts.\nI have since gone back and read most of these books and loved them! I remember laughing out loud at the first page of Pride and Prejudice, which I finally read when I was 26, and wondering how my 10th-grade self could have possibly disliked it.\nAnd yet I still hate doing the required reading. It’s antithetical to the whole spirit of reading, in my view. It’s one reason I no longer accept books for review — the process of having to read a book is simply too grueling. The freedom to read what I want when I want is a critical part of my intellectual life, and I frankly resent whenever someone tries to rob me of that freedom — even when they’re a professor I’m paying to teach me! I know, it’s messed up. The point is: I sympathize with the people who just don’t want to be forced to read books they think are bad.\nOn the other hand, I know a lot of people, many of them teachers or professors, who are very invested in the idea of forcing other people to read this book or that book. And I understand that, too. They see it not just as beneficial to their students but as a duty that is required of them by their profession. Others may feel a more generalized sense of responsibility to the young people of the world: I remember being shocked when another (quite good) YA writer told me that she never wrote anything that didn’t have some didactic purpose. She saw it as her responsibility to educate and inform young people.\nThat’s not really how I feel at all. I don’t think the work I do as a writer or a thinker has any broader purpose other than to explore ideas and raise questions. And I’m lucky to be in a field and a life situation where, honestly, nobody cares what I’ve read, and I don’t need to make choices about what other people should read.\nBut I think that, because I participate in the life of the mind without feeling any concomitant responsibilities toward young people, I can perhaps better see that kicking books out of high school curricula isn’t entirely an abridgment of free speech. To argue that nobody should be allowed to read a book is censorship, and it would be stifling to one’s art. To simply not be taught a book isn’t quite the same thing. I think there is a certain confusion here between the freedom we as writers and thinkers need to feel in our reading — we cannot feel like there’s anything we’re simply not allowed to read — and the wholly separate topic of what books children should be compelled to read.\nTo my mind, the two are very separate things. A person’s art needs to be free and unrestrained, whereas the development of curricula is a civic problem — it’s a community issue that cannot be resolved without constraint, without loss, and without change.\nNow, a person can definitely have opinions about curricula. But they need to accept that their opinions won’t necessarily be privileged. For instance, I often hear other writers, especially in my field, say they don’t have time for that old stuff, especially for books by old white men. Personally, I would never in my life advise a young writer to avoid older books. But it’s not up to me. Every person has to decide for themselves what to read. And, personally, I am very interested in the question of whether a writer who is relentlessly locked into contemporary mindsets can still write thoughtful and nuanced fiction. I doubt it, but they’re the person who will suffer, not me.\nIn fact, sometimes, the competitive part of me is a little gleeful that so many people ignore our literary history. I think, “Wow, given the amount of talent and brilliance in the world, it would be very difficult for me to produce anything worthwhile if it weren’t for the fact that so many writers are giving themselves a massive disadvantage before they’ve begun.”\nSome people try to strike a middle ground here and say, “Well, you don’t have to read white people, but you really ought to read books from before the contemporary era.” Except who are we really talking about? What nonwhite writers specifically? The Indian and Chinese and Latin American writers from before 1900 are usually just as wrapped up in prejudice and exploitation as the white writers.\nI think reading white people is important, too. I would be surprised if someone writing in English could write at their best without reading any white writers. Our language and its literary history are largely a product, until relatively late in the game, of white people. A great many of those white people had terrible and reprobate political views. I wish that wasn’t the case. I wish that there were Indian writers who were writing in English in the 19th century who could’ve played the role in the development of the English language that Dickens did, but there weren’t. Instead, we have Indian writers who came fresh to the language as a result of colonialism, and in order to fully possess and work with the language, they had to read writers like Dickens. That’s not true to the same extent today — you can write fairly well in English without reading white writers — but there are still vast parts of the English literary tradition that are inaccessible if you don’t read white writers.\nOthers, of course, see the situation quite differently. In their opinion, Dickens is poisoned by his faults (the horrendous antisemitism of Oliver Twist comes to mind), and they can’t bear to read him, much less make him a literary model. And that’s fine. They’ll be judged, as I am, not by their reading but by their work. And many of those people are much more critically and commercially successful than I am! So, I am sure they’re laughing at me right now.\nIn these times, it doesn’t really serve a writer or a thinker to become too possessive of their culture or their reading. We have to put our work first and engage in actions that support our work.\nI’ve been reading a lot of Kant lately, and I found it amusing that in his essay “What Is Enlightenment?” he says a society can only achieve Enlightenment if it allows “freedom to make public use of one’s reason in all matters.” After saying this, however, he immediately backtracks, twisting himself in knots trying to explain that, by “public use,” he only means “that use which a man, as scholar, makes of it before the reading public.” He contrasts this with the private use of reason, which is the use “a man makes of his reason in a civic post that has been entrusted to him.” (Yes, I know, he’s using public and private in exactly the opposite way we would use them today.) Sometimes, he argues, the same job involves both the public and the private use of a person’s reason. The private use is constrained, while the public use must be free. An example is a minister who is bound to preach the doctrines of his church to his congregation even though, as a scholar, he openly disagrees with those same doctrines.\nKant took care to make this distinction because he lived in 18th-century Prussia — a militarized, autocratic society where people clearly were not free to do as they wished. The Prussian state is nobody’s idea of a society conducive to freedom. But it allowed Kant to think freely and to communicate with other thoughtful people.\nI think, similarly, we are entering a time when many academics and teachers will have to confront the difference between their public and private characters. And, for a lot of people who are used to their narrative being the dominant one, this will be an unfamiliar experience. Unlike me, they work in fields that have given them status and prestige because of their reading and their expertise in what they regard as the Classics. And they’ve been free to impose their viewpoints on other people, particularly their students.\nBut now they will experience what, frankly, many marginalized people have always experienced: a sense of disjunction, a sense of working within an institution whose values are at odds with their own. And they will experience the need to subject their views to the marketplace of ideas and to risk being shouted down or vilified.\nI am glad I am not in charge of creating a curriculum for young writers. I have loved many writers who wrote things that a modern young person would find intolerable. I’m thinking of the ableism of Stefan Zweig’s Beware of Pity (1939), for instance; the bizarre phobia about lesbians in Proust; or the participation of the ancient Greeks and Romans in a vicious slave economy. As a trans woman, I have many times encountered transphobic jokes and remarks in works I’ve read and enjoyed, including some from as recently as the last 15 years (off the top of my head, I can name episodes of Bob’s Burgers, How I Met Your Mother, and 30 Rock). If I only read writers who thought that trans people were full human beings worthy of respect, I would have a very limited set of texts to read.\nNonetheless, that set would still be larger than any human being could ever read in a lifetime. And if a writer wanted to limit themselves to that group, then I would understand the principle behind it. But if they asked me, in my professional opinion, whether that would be conducive to them writing beautiful and nuanced literature — the sort of thing that can stand with the best that’s ever been thought or written — I would have to say, “You’re really hindering yourself. And given the difficulty of your goal, you should be aiming to shed hindrances, not take them on.”\nLuckily, nobody asks me that! I’m not a professor. I’m not a teacher. I don’t design curricula.

The battle lines were really drawn on words like water fountain, which some people ridiculously call bubblers, traffic circles known to some as roundabouts, which, if anyone has spent as much time as I have trying to navigate DC traffic circles, they'd know they couldn't possibly be called something as charming as \"roundabout.\" Lollipops are apparently also called suckers by some strange geographic groups. And of course there's the great soda debate. When I arrived at college I had a midwestern roommate and a southern one, and it was then that I learned that the central Ohioan called all brands of bubbly beverages, sweetened or not, caffeinated or citrusy, \"pop,\" which actually made a kind of sense to me even though it was wrong. But my North Carolinian roommate claimed it all as Coke. Even Pepsi is Coke! The expectation when ordering at a restaurant was to request a \"Coke\" and then be asked what kind--Sprite, diet, root beer, and so on.\nAbsolutely ridiculous.\nAnd now, all these years later, I find myself baffled by a different kind of puzzle having to do with the word theater, which my husband inexplicably pronounces \"THEE-der\" and my son, doubly inexplicably, pronounces \"the-AY-der.\" My husband was born in St. Louis and grew up in Providence and his parents pronounce the word theater as I do, which is to say, correctly. And my son was born in Brooklyn and is growing up in Washington DC. So you can see why it's all very confusing to me since he says basically every single other word as I do. This is not, as some mispronunciations are, an issue of a speech impediment or childlike pronunciation, with which I am familiar.\nMy seven-year-old does a wonderful thing with her R's. At first she couldn't say them at all really, and they came out as W's, which I know is common. Her R's then transitioned briefly to a kind of Hebrew \"resh\" sound, and now there's something else happening, a kind of folding in of the sound, which is the only way I can really put it, and I absolutely love it because it's like her own sound, her own language, which is not the same thing as an inexplicable mispronunciation. And I know that some day she will be taught to fix this, and that some parents might already have gotten it taken care of, but we haven't yet seen a need. It's not that we are encouraging childish mispronunciations--except when we are, as is the case in our home with blueberries (bupahdees) and cucumbers (cucaboos and cumayas, both), because there is something so utterly charming to parents about the ways in which our children hear words, bring them into their heads and then back out of their mouths with different sounds, and in this case I simply cannot let go of the two-year-old pronunciations. But we're also not telling our children they're wrong, even in the case of the mysterious theater, because, it seems to me, as a parent I spend so very much of my time correcting, either gently, or not-so-gently.\nAnd maybe it would be nicer to think of all of this correcting as guiding. Is it not, after all, our job as parents to guide these little beings we created? To mold them in the image we believe is best, the one that will lead them to live lives of goodness and meaning and service, to help them to be good citizens, mensches in their communities, and maybe even to pronounce words correctly, or at least within the New York Times realm of their regional dialects?\nThis was easier when all we were trying to teach our children was to not eat bandaids found in the playground sandbox, or not to bite other kids when they're taking too long with the play-doh. But now that my children are older--old enough, even, to notice the very many ways and styles in which other families - other parents - are doing it, are raising their children, guiding them, correcting them--this has become infinitely harder because not only are we still eking out this path for them, sometimes (okay, most of the time) as we go along and as they age, we are now also eking it out while being asked WHY we are doing it the way we are, as opposed to, say, the ways other families are, and we are being asked this by our five-, seven-, and nine- year olds whose intellectual sophistication seems to fluctuate by the minute. So my husband and I are trying to teach our children that, for now, they have no choice but to do the things the way our family does them because we think our ways are best, while at the same time attempting diplomacy on the part of their friends' families' ways, which has led me to be the kind of desperately unlikable person who says things like \"well, in our family we only have one dessert after lunch and that's just the way it is.\"\nSo yes, for those of us who aren't struggling to meet our childrens' most basic physical needs, who are downright lucky enough to be able to spend time thinking about all of this stuff, there are different ways to do it, to love children and give them the platform they need to become all the things we hope for them. Heck, there are different ways to do this within a family according to each child's needs and personality! And we're all just stumbling along, hoping what we want for them is right, praying that the path we're laying for them will guide them there and that they'll learn how to continue on it someday without us. There is no one right way.\nExcept, obviously, when it comes to pronouncing the word theater. All of which, of course, brings me to tuna salad.\nThere are many ways to make tuna salad. Many of them are passable, and some of them are even quite good, but there is actually only one fully right way to make it, which is the way my mother made it, and all of the other ways are just inferior. No judgment here, just truth.\nTo make the right kind of tuna salad first you have to buy cans of tuna in water. Bumblebee is best because that's what my mom always bought. You have to squeeze out the excess water before dumping the fish into a bowl. This step is kind of gross but absolutely can't be avoided. Next you have to chop celery into small pieces. Not too small, though. Half an arch should do, and if you don't know what I mean about that I'm sorry. The celery goes in the bowl with the tuna. Now add the juice of a lemon, or two, depending on the size and juiciness of the lemon, as well as so very much mayonnaise (Hellman's is best here) you have to close your eyes while you're spooning it or squeezing it in. Then comes salt and pepper--more grinds of pepper than you think you need. Mix it all really well and taste it and see if you need more mayo. You do.\nKeep it in a sealed container in the fridge and use it for a tuna melt on a bagel. When it's Passover, eat it on matzah. When it's not Passover, eat it on everything else, like toast or pita chips or tortilla chips or crackers.\nYou'll probably make it again soon.\nSometimes it's okay for there to be just one right way to do things.\nSometimes it's easier that way.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line700619"}

By 1921, when Prinzhorn left Heidleberg, this collection had grown to include over 5000 works by about 350 patients. Prinzhorn’s 1922 book Artistry of the Mentally Ill (profusely illustrated with images from the Heidelberg collection), was the first attempt to analyse this type of art, that subsequently became known as ‘Outsider Art’. Prinzhorn was interested in the borderline between psychiatry and art, mental illness and self-expression, and his work became very influential among artists, especially the Expressionists and Surrealists, with their interest in self expression and in visualising the working of the unconscious mind.\nAs most serious artists and designers are interested in the act of perception and cognition – the way we transmute the visual and other sensual input from the outside world into mental images – and how we then illustrate these images and evoke them with works of art, Prinzhorn’s book stands out as the first major study to analyse these issues. Of course we know much more now of the workings of the brain, and have begun to develop coherent theories of the Mind (see for example Marvin Minsky’s Society of Mind, and Daniel Dennet’s Consciousness Explained), but the issues addressed by Prinzhorn are still central to these developments. ‘Outsider Art’ is the label now used to describe the art of the mentally ill, the ‘naive’ work of untrained ‘folk artists’, the work of so-called primitive tribes and other similar artefacts, and remains a source of inspiration for artists, nor merely in the radically unconventional images that are produced by ‘outsiders’ but as evidence of these process of perception, cognition and expression that are central to all our experiences of art and design.\nOther good books on this subject: Steven Rose: From Brains to Consciousness, Igor Aleksander: How to Build a Mind, and Margaret Boden: The Creative Mind.\nPosted on June 2, 2014 June 2, 2014 Author bobcottonFormat ImageTags 1922, Art, book, Hans Prinzhorn, Mentally Ill 1 Comment","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1344195"}

His death, during surgury, passed almost entirely unnoticed in America, even among Greek-Americans, but he was deeply mourned throughout Greece.\nI was in Greece when he died and had the good fortune of seeing and talking with this great and holy man just five days before his “falling asleep.” The editor of an Athenian religious monthly asked me to write an obituary . . . I have undertaken to write this brief biography.\nPhotios Kontoglou was born on November 8, 1895, at Kydoniai (Aivali), on the west coast of Asia Minor, across from Mytilene. Kydoniai was a city consisting of about 30,000 Greeks and three persons—the district governor, the judge, and the tax collector—who were Turks.\nKontoglou came from a devout family, which had its own chapel containing precious articles including a carved ancient crucifix and a large panel icon depicting Saint Paraskevi. Many of his ancestors were monks, and an uncle, Stephanos Kontoglou, was abbot of the Monastery of Saint Paraskevi near Kydoniai. Stephanos was an important influence in Photios’s life. In his book Vasanta (1923), Kontoglou dedicates the chapter of translations from the Psalms of David “to the austere soul of the Hieromonk Stephanos Kontoglou, my uncle, whose virtue I perpetually have before me as a model and rule.”\nThe young Kontoglou was extremely fond of the sea, sailing, and the solitude of the deserted neighboring islets. He liked to live alone, like Robinson Crusoe. Daniel Defoe’s hero fascinated Kontoglou; he mentions him in many of his writings.\nAfter graduating from the famous Academy of Gymnasium of Kydoniai, Kontoglou spent several years in Europe, especially in France, studying art and acquiring painting techniques. He lived in Paris during the First World War, where he first gained attention, winning prizes for his paintings and his writings. His first book, a novel entitled Pedro Cazas, was written and published there in 1919.\nAfter the armistice, Kontoglou returned to Kydoniai. In 1920 he wrote a remarkable prologue for the second edition of Pedro Cazas which was published in Athens in 1922. In this prologue he set forth some of the basic ideas by which he abided ever after.\nPersecuted by the Turks, he and his family went to Thermi, Mytilene, in 1922. Later he resided in Athens, but always lived on the outskirts, as he disliked the distractions of cities. When the Kontoglou family left Kydoniai, they took only the sacred articles mentioned above and a few Church books. These were his most cherished possessions. After his death his wife, Maria, fulfilling his wish, gave them to the Monastery of Saint Paraskevi at Nea Makri in Attica.\nIn Athens Kontoglou soon became well-known in literary circles as a result of his highly-praised book, Pedro Cazas. His reputation as a writer grew with the appearance of two additional books: Vasanta (a Sanskrit word meaning “springtime”) in 1923, and Taxidia (“Travels”) in 1928, and the literary and art periodical Filikh Etairia (“Friendly Society”) which he founded in 1925. Within a few years, Kontoglou had won an enviable place in the Greek world of letters, admired for his style—which is characterized by clarity, simplicity, vigor and warmth—as well as his remarkable observations and profound thoughts.\nAs a painter, Kontoglou was slow in winning recognition. He had to overcome difficult obstacles. After leaving Europe, he became increasingly impressed by the Byzantine traditions of painting and decided to master this style of painting. But he had to become his own teacher and learn the secrets of Byzantine art. He did this by reading old manuscripts and visiting Byzantine monuments, patiently studying the works of the old masters.\nFurther, Kontoglou had to overcome strong prejudice on the part of the public against Byzantine art. Having won their liberation from the Turks, the Greeks began to turn the West for prototypes in art, especially the adoption of European (particularly Italian Renaissance) models and techniques. According to the European view at that time, Byzantine civilization was a lower civilization, not worthy of serious study, and Byzantine art especially was lower, almost barbaric art. Kontoglou succeeded magnificently in overcoming both obstacles, but it took time.\nThe first obstacle was by far easier to overcome. He learned his most important lessons about Byzantine art at the Holy Mountain of Athos and at Mystra. It is significant that while at Athos, he wrote several chapters, the preface and profound concluding chapter on the fine arts of his second book, Vasanta. It was also at Athos that one of his three poems in this book was inspired by a Byzantine painting in a very old chapel there. His debt to Athos in his development as an iconographer is evinced by a volume published in 1925 containing photographs of copies, executed by him, of Byzantine frescoes at Athos; and also by the illustrations in two issues of Filikh Etairia that year showing panel icons of the Monastery of Iviron rendered by him.\nKontoglou visited Mystra not long after. He made copies of some of the wall paintings in the Byzantine churches at Mystra. He later worked there for a long time cleaning wall paintings in the Church of Peribleptos.\nComparing Byzantine and European religious art, Kontoglou says in his book Taxidia, “In the countries of Europe there are churches with paintings that are famous for their artistic merit; yet they do not have the mystery and the power of evoking contrition (katanyxis) possessed by the icons that were done by some unlettered and simple Byzantine painters.”\nAround 1930, Kontoglou was appointed technical supervisor at the Byzantine Museum in Athens. He possessed both great love for the works in the museum, and technical knowledge for cleaning and preserving them.\nIn 1932, Kontoglou published a slender volume entitled Icones et Fresques d’Art Byzantine, with twenty plates of Byzantine panel icons and frescoes he copied. He continued to paint panel icons during this period.\nDuring the later thirties, Kontoglou decorated three large rooms of the City Hall of Athens with historical frescoes. This was his first large scale work as a fresco painter, and his only extensive secular one. His next major achievement as a fresco painter was the iconographic decoration of the large Church Zoodochos Peghi at Liopesi (Paiania), a town near Athens. He began the work in 1939, but could not resume it until after the Second World War. When I met Kontoglou in 1952, he showed me the beautiful Byzantine murals he had painted at Liopesi.\nKontoglou wrote at least eight books between 1942 and 1945, during the war. Most are rather short. The longest and important is Mystikos Kepos (“Mystical Garden”) in 1944. His chapters on Piety (Theosveia) and Saint Isaac the Syrian are masterpieces, full of deep religious feeling. He speaks of other remarkable ascetics of Syria and Mesopotamia, and stresses the virtues of faith, humility and purity.\nThe most fruitful period for Kontoglou, as both painter and writer, was the last twenty years of his life. Assisted by several of his talented pupils, he painted numerous panel icons in churches in many parts of Greece, as well as in the United States and other countries, and many thousands of square yards of wall paintings. After the church at Liopesi, mentioned above, Kontoglou frescoed the entire interior of the Church of Saint Andrew off Patission Street at Athens. He did wall paintings for the new Metropolitan Church of Evangelismos in Rhodes and the Church of Saint George at Stemnitsa, Arcadia. Finally, he decorated with fresco icons the eastern apse, central dome, pendentives and barrel vaults below the dome, and other surfaces of the following Athenian churches: Kapnikarea, Saint George at Kypseli, Saint Haralambos in the park Pedion tou Areos, Saint Nicholas at Kato Patissia, and others.\nThrough these works, through the training of many gifted young artists in the techniques of Byzantine iconography, and through his long, luminous and spirited defense of Byzantine art which culminated in 1961 in the monumental two-volume work entitled Ekphrasis (“Expression”) in which he teaches the theory and practice of Byzantine iconography, Kontoglou succeeded in making this art prevail in Greece. His influence spread to America, where many churches have been decorated with panel icons, frescoes and mosaics by his pupils.\nDuring the same period, he wrote such edifying books as A Great Sign (1945), with accounts of many extraordinary recent miracles at Thermi, Mytilene; The Life and Conduct of Blaise Pascal (1947); The Life and Ascesis of Our Holy Father Saint Mark the Anchorite (1947, translated in The Orthodox Word, no. 1, Sept.-Oct., 1966, with illustrations by Kontoglou); Fount of Life (1951), presenting brief descriptions of the lives and selections from the teachings of some of the great Saints of the Orthodox Church; The Holy Gospel According to Matthew, Interpreted (1952); Expression (1961); and What Orthodoxy Is and What Papism Is (1964). Kontoglou also translated into Greek Leonid Ouspensky’s L’Icone: Quelques Mots sur son Sens Dogmatique, and published it with a preface and notes of his own. Together with the young theologian Basil Moustakis, Kontoglou founded and edited Kivotos (1952–1955), a religious periodical concerned especially with Orthodox spirituality.\nKontoglou contributed many articles to various other periodicals and encyclopedias. His articles in the Athenian daily Elephtheria are so numerous that they would fill several volumes. Many of them are among the most profound written by a Greek. Most are concerned with religious themes, such as faith and reason, religion and philosophy, religious versus secular art, Byzantine iconography and music, the lives of Martyrs and other Saints, and so on.\nKontoglou won the Academy of Athens Prize for his book Ekphrasis, in 1961, and the Purfina Prize for his book Aivali; My Native Place, in 1963. The latter is the first volume of his Erga (“Works”) which began to be published by Astir Publishing Company at Athens in 1962.\nIn recognition of his great achievements as an author, the Academy of Athens, the highest cultural institution in Greece, awarded him on March 24, 1965, its Aristeion Grammaton, its highest prize in letters.\nKontoglou also carried on an enormous correspondence. He once told me that he wrote about fifty letters a month, corresponding not only with Greeks, but also Americans, Finns, Frenchmen, Germans, Russians, Ugandans and others. He had countless friends and admirers throughout the world who sought his guidance on iconography, and on Orthodox doctrine and living.\nIn Kontoglou’s writings, we encounter a man who has unshakable religious faith, free from all skepticism and metaphysical anguish. We encounter a man who is steeped in the Holy Scriptures and writings of the Eastern Church Fathers, particularly the great mystics such as Saint Macarios the Egyptian, Saint John Climacos, Saint Isaac the Syrian, Saint Symeon the New Theologian, and Saint Gregory the Sinaite. We find a man who has the profoundest respect for the Sacred Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy, including all its dogmas, canons and sacred arts (architecture, iconography, music), tolerating no deviations. Orthodoxy was for him the sacred Kivotos, the sacred Ark, and these its precious contents, which must be carefully guarded and not cast away, or exchanged for counterfeits.\nKontoglou was strongly opposed to the participation of Orthodoxy in “ecumenism,” seeing in such participation the dangers of compromise on matters which admit of no compromise. He was especially critical of the maneuvers of Patriarch Athenagoras, in whom he saw an apostate . . . a betrayer of Greece and Orthodoxy. In his last book, entitled Ti Einai he Orthodoxia kai ti Einai ho Papismos (“What Orthodoxy Is and What Papsim Is”) Kontoglou stressed the abyss that separates Orthodoxy from Roman Catholicism, which renders utterly absurd Athenagoras’s assertions that there are no real differences between the two.\nKontoglou was a man of adamantine Orthodox faith and impeccable character, adorned with the virtues of great humility, long-suffering, courage, wisdom, purity, hope and love. He was a devout man, a holy man, a man of God. All that he did bears the impress of these qualities.\nAs during his life, so at his death, it was evident that Kontoglou was free from worldly attachments, a citizen of the City of God, not of the earthly city, whose glory is temporary and whose power is doomed to pass away. He died poor, ignored by the State. His body was not accompanied to the grave by any State dignitaries, but only by friends and admirers, who loved him deeply.\nThis article was originally published by the Monastery of St. John, www.monasteryofstjohn.org, in The Divine Ascent Vol. 3/4.

In 2033, the age requirement will increase further to 75.\nMany financial experts have been discussing the possibility of this change for some time, and it is seen as a positive development for investors. This change allows for individuals to keep their retirement savings invested for longer and potentially grow their nest egg.\nHowever, it is important to note that the 2033 implementation date for the age 75 RMD requirement means that some retirees will miss out on this change and may be required to take early RMDs. Despite this, the change to the RMD age requirement is still seen as a win for investors as it changes the considerations and planning for retirement. Additionally, the Secure Act includes other changes that will impact retirement planning.\nWhat is a Required Minimum Distribution or RMD?\nFor those who may not be familiar with the term, a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) is a requirement set by Congress for individuals to withdraw a certain amount of money from their retirement accounts. The purpose of this requirement is to prevent individuals from using their retirement accounts as a personal piggy bank and to ensure that taxes are paid on the money in these accounts.\nRMDs are required for a variety of retirement accounts, including 401ks, traditional IRAs, and even some annuities. The amount that must be withdrawn is determined by the IRS and increases over time. The purpose of RMDs is to make sure that the money in these accounts is eventually depleted, and taxes are paid on the withdrawals.\nHowever, this requirement can be a burden on retirees. For example, if an individual only needs to withdraw $20,000 or $30,000 a year to supplement their income, but the IRS requires them to withdraw a much larger amount, it can bump them up into a higher tax bracket and affect their other sources of income such as social security.\nThe Secure Act 2.0 has made changes to the RMD age requirement, allowing individuals to delay taking RMDs until age 73 in 2023 and age 75 in 2033. This change is seen as a positive development for investors as it allows them to keep their retirement savings invested for longer. However, some financial experts advocate for abolishing RMDs entirely as they can deplete retirement savings and bump retirees into higher tax brackets. As financial planners, retirees, and investors, it is important to be aware of these requirements and take steps to protect our retirement savings from unnecessary depletion.\nWays to Mitigate The Tax Burden of RMDs\nWhile the changes to RMDs in the Secure Act 2.0 are positive for retirees, the question of whether or not the genie can be put back in the bottle remains. However, there are strategies that can be employed to help mitigate the tax burden in retirement and control the income that is received during retirement.\nOne key strategy is to be strategic about where income is received from in retirement. This may mean deferring social security benefits or taking them earlier and using retirement accounts to supplement that income. By controlling the income that is received during the years leading up to RMDs, individuals can offset it with credits, deductions, or exclusions on their tax return.\nAnother important change in the Secure Act 2.0 is the decrease in the penalty for not taking RMDs. The penalty has been reduced from 50% to 25%, which changes the calculus for retirees. It may now make more sense for some individuals to not take an RMD in a given year if it results in a lower tax bill. Additionally, the penalty for correcting a missed RMD has been reduced to 10%, making it easier for individuals to fix any mistakes they may have made.\nIt is important to note that the IRS has yet to release the rules for these changes, so it is crucial for individuals to stay informed and consult with a financial advisor to determine the best course of action for their retirement planning. It is also worth noting that a lot of the software and online tools available for retirement planning are not yet updated to reflect these new rules and regulations, which may significantly change the assumptions and plans these tools provide.\nContribution Limits Get a Boost\nThe Secure Act 2.0 also includes an increase in catch-up contributions for certain types of retirement accounts in 2025. This change is in line with recent updates to the tax code, which have been inflation-adjusted to better reflect the needs of individuals and to keep pace with the cost of living.\nHistorically, tax brackets and contribution limits were fixed dollar amounts and were not updated frequently enough to keep pace with inflation. This made it difficult for individuals to save enough for retirement and for catch-up contributions to be meaningful.\nThe Secure Act 2.0 addresses this issue by updating the contribution numbers and making them inflation-adjusted. This means that Congress will not need to pass a law every year or every time to update these numbers, and they will automatically reflect reality and people's needs. Additionally, this change transfers control of these updates to the IRS, which is generally more favorable to individuals saving for retirement.\nOverall, the Secure Act 2.0's increase in catch-up contributions, along with the other changes it made, is a positive development for individuals saving for retirement and it shows a shift towards retirement planning and tax code that is more beneficial for individuals and less controlled by Congress.\nFor those looking for more information on the Secure Act 2.0 and its impact on retirement planning, there are several resources available.\nOne resource is this article that I have written on the Secure Act 2.0, which provides more detail on the changes and their impact on retirement planning. Additionally, I will be offering webinars and more articles in the coming weeks that delve deeper into the different areas of the Secure Act 2.0 and how they impact retirement planning.\nI am also working on a tool to help individuals with social security and retirement planning in the context of the Secure Act 2.0.

The size of the populations in urban centers is creating demands that overwhelm the capacity of infrastructures, particularly in times of distress.\nResearchers at UTSA are working to remedy this problem. Through a $100,000 planning grant from the National Science Foundation, a team of researchers with expertise in engineering, computing, infrastructures, cyber-physical systems, political science, public policy and STEM education is leading the creation of the Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities.\nThe Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities will develop transforming technologies for one of the most important societal problems we currently face: engineering critical infrastructures of large population centers to achieve sustainable growth while improving equity and well-being of residents.\nTo achieve this mission, the center will develop the underlying science for a distributed sensor and data science framework to assist authorities and the private sector as they make decisions that yield the most benefit to urban residents.\nThe center will enable research and technology to improve urban infrastructure resilience. The proposed research will support superior real-time data processing, storage and dissemination to accelerate processing of large data sets in digital communities. Data analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence experts will advance fundamental knowledge in their collective domains. Computing researchers will have access to the complete data flow chain and be able to study networking weaknesses against cyberattacks.\nThe networking will include narrowband and broadband wireless and wired data communication, networking with traditional and emerging sensor cloud environments, and various interfaces.\nResearchers will develop critical infrastructure management and health informatics applications capable of exploring interdependences between these domains. Infrastructure researchers will leverage these advances to study efficiency and resilience of urban infrastructures during normal operating conditions and during different types of disruptions, such as hurricanes, floods and chemical spills using real-time data.\n“UTSA is uniquely positioned to lead research advances in this area through an existing foundation of strategic initiatives and research centers on sustainability, climate science, water resources, data science, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence and energy,” said Adolfo Matamoros, a Peter T. Flawn Distinguished Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering at UTSA. “These strategic initiatives have been developed in close collaboration with partners from industry, the City of San Antonio, federal agencies, research institutes and the U.S. military. The Engineering Research Center for Sustainable Urban Communities will build on this foundation to advance smart city science and technology development and expand to include workforce development.”\nThrough this planning grant, a diverse group of stakeholders will join forces to develop consensus on advances in science and engineering needed to achieve sustainable growth of urban ecosystems through convergent research. The outcomes of the planning will provide a roadmap to guide future research efforts and foster new collaboration not previously considered.\nTwo stakeholder workshops will be held to develop a vision, goals and research plan that reflect the concerns and priorities of the San Antonio community. The first will be held on Friday, Jan. 24 from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the John Peace Library, Faculty Center (JPL 4.04.16) on the Main Campus. A second stakeholder workshop will be held in April.\n— Julie Paulson","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line223057"}

Photo by James Holt.\nNeal Kosaly-Meyer plays the piano one note at a time. Or at least, that’s the idea behind his ongoing performance series Gradus: For Fux, Tesla and Milo the Wrestler. He devotes an extended improvisation (20 minutes or longer) to each individual note on the piano, and to as many combinations of notes as possible.\nThis Saturday at the Chapel Performance Space he will perform one installment of the series: 40 minutes on one note (C sharp to be specific), 20 minutes on five notes in multiple octaves, and 60 minutes on two notes. Extended periods of silence are incorporated into all three sections. Kosaly-Meyer flips a coin to determine the number of notes per movement, how long the movements will be, and how much silence will be interspersed in each movement.\nThe idea for Gradus presented itself to Kosaly-Meyer over 30 years ago while he was a graduate student in the School of Music at the University of Washington. He had been thinking a lot about John Cage and how composers could follow in his footsteps by challenging preconceived notions of what music could be.\n“It’s hard to find the frontier after a composer like Cage, who went right out to the edge of so many frontiers,” Kosaly-Meyer said. “This thought, learn to play the piano one note at a time, was kind of a thread to be able to push to do music that felt like it was on an edge, that felt like there was a risk being taken.”\nStill, it wasn’t until he moved to San Diego with his wife and was able to play on a grand piano at a church he attended that he began to really explore the idea. Kosaly-Meyer believes performing on a grand piano is pivotal to Gradus.\n“It’s not something you could do on an electronic keyboard or even an upright piano,” Kosaly-Meyer said. “I think to do something where you actually have enough sound, enough reverberation for a project like this to be interesting requires a grand piano.”\nHe began with 40 minutes improvising on the lowest A on the piano, and then began using combinations of As. Implicit in the idea of learning to play the piano one note at a time was the idea of learning to play differently by finding artistry in each sound. With attack, duration, dynamics, and intricate pedaling techniques, Kosaly-Meyer developed the ability to make a wide assortment of sounds using just one A.\nHis work temporarily came to a halt when he moved again and no longer had access to a grand piano. But years later, in 2001, his friend Keith Eisenbrey helped solve that problem.\nKosaly-Meyer met Eisenbrey while taking composition courses at the UW. They had done a lot of improvisation work together, and Kosaly-Meyer was able to develop the Gradus project and other works by bouncing ideas off of Eisenbrey. They became family when Eisenbrey married Kosaly-Meyer’s sister Karen, and in 2001 Kosaly-Meyer was able to continue with Gradus by rehearsing on Eisenbrey’s grand piano.\nWhen he began sharing Gradus, it was positive feedback from Eisenbrey and other composers that emboldened Kosaly-Meyer to move forward with this musical venture. He began his annual performance series in 2002 in Seattle.\nKosaly-Meyer determined that Gradus works best with a two-hour, three-part structure that allows him to separate what he sees as three distinct ways of making music.\n“I had come to a conclusion after working on this a little bit that playing with one note is a particular kind of making music, playing with two notes is another kind of making music that’s very different than just playing with one, and that playing with 3 or more notes is very different than playing with two,” he said.\nDrawing inspiration from Cage, Kosaly-Meyer chose to incorporate silence—which really means all unintended ambient sounds—as an equal partner in the performance. If weather permits, Kosaly-Meyer leaves the windows open at the Chapel, allowing highway noise, barking dogs, and audiences’ creaking benches and coughs to form a chorus that supports his playing.\n“I always found in improvising that music happened much more organically with an ensemble. Even if it was just an ensemble of two, it was so much easier for something musical to happen,” Kosaly-Meyer said. “Gradus is really the first kind of solo improvisation project I find that can stay musical and I think the trick is that it’s not really a solo project.”\nThis particular performance is dedicated to the late jazz pianist Cecil Taylor, who displayed incredible control over each and every note he played, no matter how intricate the performance. Kosaly-Meyer was also interested in exploring the interplay between the ideas of Taylor and Cage, who were at odds during their lifetimes because of Cage’s aversion to jazz and improvisation. Gradus combines Taylor’s spontaneity with Cage’s interest in silence as an equal partner.\n“One thing that’s going on in Gradus is an attempt to harmonize a Cage way of thinking with a Cecil Taylor way of thinking,” Kosaly-Meyer said.\nNeal Kosaly-Meyer presents Gradus: For Fux, Tesla and Milo the Wrestler this Saturday, July 14 at 8pm at the Chapel Performance Space at the Good Shepherd Center.

Courtesy of Pyramid Atlantic Art Center.\nOpening Reception: Friday, September 6 from 6:30pm to 9pm\nArtist Talk: Friday, September 13 from 7pm to 8:30pm\nArtist Imar Hutchins exhibits six of his larger-than-life portrait collages in INHERITANCE. Each work measures 6 feet tall and 4.5 feet wide with subjects ranging from the artist’s mother to the late musician, Prince. The works combine screenprinting, collage, and painting, resulting in intensely detailed and colorful depictions of these figures: some iconic in pop culture and some iconic to the artist himself.\nINHERITANCE is curated by Zoma Wallace and runs September 6 through October 6, 2019. An artist talk will take place on Friday, September 13 from 7 – 8:30 pm.\n“All inheritance is not financial. All inheritance is not physical. And we can inherit from people who are not our direct ancestors. I would challenge people to think more broadly about inheritance. People, like the ones I depict, all have things to give us if we can receive them. They have lessons to teach us, but we need to be open to receiving that inheritance,” remarks Hutchins.\nMuch of Hutchins’ work is commission-based with a specified subject. However, Hutchins is selective about who he tackles. “I won’t do anyone’s portrait unless they are intergalactic…vibrating on a high frequency with something to share with us, with the world.” Once the figure is chosen, Hutchins begins researching his subject, which can take up to a year. “I need to be able to add something to the conversation, especially for someone who has been depicted a lot. What is it that people are missing about this person?”\nHutchins does everything himself when making a work, including milling the wood for his frames. The entire piece is imbued with intentionality from the beginning. “I want to be responsible for the whole thing. People feel it, whether it’s conscious or subconscious. You can tell when someone has put a lot of love in something.”\nINHERITANCE is a rare opportunity to see multiple pieces by Hutchins in a single space. The exhibition will travel to the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky before all the works move on to their patrons, including private collectors and public institutions—such as the University of Kentucky, which commissioned a portrait of Hutchins’ grandfather who brought about the University’s integration 70years ago. Upon close inspection, viewers see that Hutchins has reproduced and collaged the hate mail sent to his grandfather in this piece, turning many small works of hate into one large work of love.\nIn addition to the large-scale canvases, Hutchins has created a limited edition screenprint based on his James Baldwin collage that will also be on view and available for sale at Pyramid. The Baldwin print is in honor of what would have been Baldwin’s 95th birthday this month. Hutchins selects only 1 or 2 of his collages a year to re-work into a print. “I love that kind of iconic poster art look, and each of my prints is really its own work, inspired by, but separate from, the collage. The basic shape will be the same, but the print design consists solely of areas of color. In some ways the prints are simplified versions of the larger pieces…all my work is …all my work is trying to be simple and at the same time evocative.”\nHutchins is a self-taught artist based in Washington, D.C. He is owner of DC’s iconic Florida Avenue Grill and was lawyer until about 5 years ago when he grew his artistic practice to a full time commitment. Hutchins works primarily in collage, mixed media and printmaking. His portraits combine vintage Black magazines, hate mail and other historical documents as well as found objects, tissue paper and new materials. He imagines that people themselves are collages.\nThis exhibition is made possible in part through funding from the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, Department of Parks and Recreation, Prince George’s County.\nTuesday through Saturday: 10 am–6 pm\nSunday: 12–5 pm\nThe exhibition, reception, and artist talk are FREE and open to the public.\nPyramid Atlantic is located at 4318 Gallatin Street, Hyattsville Maryland 20781.

Bell revealed the donor’s name in a press conference at 10 a.m. outside the library’s new location at 954 Skyline Drive, which was previously home to the Searcy Athletic Club.\nBell said the new library would be named the Janett Crain Memorial Library in honor of Crain’s late wife, who worked with many service organizations in Searcy. At the conference, Crain and Barry Hoffmann, the architect for the project, unveiled a rendering of the new library’s exterior.\nBell said the new public space was designed for all Searcy residents to enjoy.\n“It’s really a community center, and we want people to feel that way about it,” Bell said.\nCrain said he wanted to support the library renovation so people would have access to free internet services and because the project could have a positive impact on the local economy and commerce. Crain said he was also inspired to donate to this project because his wife loved education, children and serving the community.\n“So she’s really the heart of this,” Crain said.\nCrain said he grew up in Searcy and went on to work in the accounting and business fields. He owns multiple companies, including one that oversees car dealerships throughout Arkansas, the Crain Automotive Team website said. He also owns Crain Media, which runs seven FM radio stations in the state.\nFriends of the Library Foundation board member Jan Smith said the renovation project would cost $5.3 million, according to a 2021 feasibility study. The new library would contain 33,000 square feet, three times more than the current building on East Pleasure Avenue. The money would go towards adding a coffee shop, career center, space for teenagers and children, media program room, and other features to the library, Smith said.\n“I envision this new library as a showplace for Searcy and a place we can all be proud to share,” Smith said.\nThe board unsuccessfully campaigned for a new public library in 2017, Smith said. In early 2021, the Searcy Athletic Club building became available, so library board members teamed up with city officials to fund the purchase of the building.\nRegional library director Darla Ino said she was thrilled and surprised when she learned about Crain’s donation. She said the board hopes to reach 75% of their fundraising goal before advancing to the public phase of the renovation.\nLibrary fundraising committee member Willie Abrams said he hoped Crain’s donation would encourage others to contribute money to renovating the library.\n“This is a major gift to challenge others in Searcy to step up so that we can have this in our community,” Abrams said.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line92939"}

Can you talk about these concerns and why they want to do away with in-person visitation?\nBennu Hannibal: Certain members of FAM have that interpretation and are expressing it. As for myself, I haven’t seen anything specific as to what Securus and ADOC’s plan is, but that doesn’t mean it’s not their overall plan. We do know that video visitation is already happening in other states, because Securus is a national brand. And we can extrapolate from those conversations and things that we are already aware of what the plan is for Alabama. We also know that some county jails are already using video visitation exclusively.\nWhatever the decision, we know that it will be decided by economics and not what is best for the families. Under the current model, aside from the vending machines, the state doesn’t make any money on in-person visitation.\nBennu Hannibal Ra-Sun\nOn the flip side, they have costs associated with physical visitation, like having security staff to harass and inspect visitors, perform strip searches, etc. These are all costs to the operational budget of a prison that disappear with video visitation kiosks. So, they probably compared the numbers from what they are making off normal visitation, in contrast to what they will make off the contracts with Securus, including the other services that Securus will be charging for us to use their tablets, etc., and decided that if they go to video visitation and make whatever else they will make off these contracts — then that is more profitable and preferable to do.\nI don’t know if they would switch to a system where in-person is only once a month, once every 90 days, or you have to earn it or whatever. But people in prison and our families should not have to pay to talk to our loved ones, and we should never be denied the basic need for human contact that all human beings need.\nSecurus is an unscrupulous company that has been caught and sued for providing location-tracking information to law enforcement, bounty hunters and bondsmen, which was used to track people and their family members — and that shows that they are willing to be a part of the police state and prison-industrial complex.\nThese companies have no incentive to be concerned with what the family members have to say or are going through. It is very clear that they have some perception of the financial exploitation that goes into prison plantation management, and they are not constrained by principles when it comes to human suffering to make their profits.\nDC: The other four companies in this Economic Blackout that are being boycotted are JPay, Access Corrections, Union Supply Company and Alabama Correctional Industries. What are their roles in the slavery system of Alabama prisons?\nBH: It’s not just about the Alabama prisons. Alabama doesn’t have JPay. The reason we added some of these companies is to give people in other states the opportunity to be a part of the Economic Blackout protest as well, because it is affecting all of us.\nEven though the original idea of this economic boycott by Kinetik Justice was and has remained for the most part a statewide effort, I thought it would be wise to add other companies that provide similar services in other states to leave room for other states to get involved, to create an opportunity to build unity and to show that we are all in this together — because the actions we are taking in Alabama are related to the actions around the country.\nUnion Supply and Access Secure are prison profiteers involved in the overpriced incentive package and accessory programs that are used to exploit and extort money from us and our families. These companies provide their services to prisons nationwide and enjoy exclusive monopoly contracts with prisoncrats and politicians. We need to be getting at all of them, all across the country, all at the same time.\nThrough actions like the Economic Blackout, we want families to understand why we have to start demanding audits of these companies, so that we can show people what’s really going on.\nAnother thing I want to do while we raise awareness is to find five families that are willing to have their personal finances audited, so that they can see in exact dollar amount terms how much they are contributing to incarceration and enslavement by investing in these exploitative companies. When people start seeing how much money is being made, they’ll then start asking where is the money going? Family members will see that they are paying for all these weapons, the mace and rubber bullets, the night sticks and electric shields that are used to harm us — and that these suppliers and prison officials are getting rich off it all.\nIt is profits that are made and the kickbacks to the operating budgets that keep the structure of the incarceration system and its laws intact. It is the economic contributions and free or cheap prison labor that form the pillars that uphold the system; and when those pillars are stressed and broken, the entire system collapses.\nThese economic boycott campaigns are to get people to see what their money is going to and what the system would look like if they took all their JPay money out, all their Securus money out — what that would look like. Would it be better, or would it be worse? There has to be a scientific application of “What am I dealing with?”\nThe budget of Alabama prisons is $600,000,000. If we take the labor out, what does that do to the budget? If we take incentive packages out, what does that do to the budget? If we take the canteen money out, what does that do to the budget? And so on and so forth.\nDC: In 2018, you wrote an incredible article called “Seeing the problem, being the solution, making the sacrifice.” (tinyurl.com/y4vhskez) In it, you speak extensively of the need to use social media, as in creating a mobile app for your organization that tells of all ongoing prison strikes, hunger strikes and all economic boycotts similar to that going down right now. Could you talk about the role that social media and technology have played in expanding these growing economic blackouts?\nBH: We started using social media as part of our core strategy back in 2014 with our YouTube channel and Facebook page. When I came to prison back in 2001, I was shocked at the living conditions. I shared with the guys in prison that we needed a camcorder to document this stuff. I was 100% convinced that people in society had no idea that living conditions were that bad. Hell, I had friends and my brother in prison at the time, and I had no idea people were living this way.\nSo when the time came for me to put the blueprint for the Free Alabama Movement together, I knew that social media would play a very important role in the way we got our message and our proof out. I knew I could take that phone, create the social media platforms, and use this technology to push the Movement forward in unique ways.\nAs for the mobile app, I simply see this as the evolution in the area of technology for our Movement. There is a lot of activism taking place around the country on the inside of U.S. prisons, jails and detention facilities, but people don’t know how to wade through all the social media content to find out about it, because the information is hard to find.\nFor example, right now there is a hunger strike going on in an ICE detention center in New Jersey, with others joining in daily. There is action in Pennsylvania and other places that kicked off mostly at the start of the year. There is our economic boycott here in Alabama, which includes several hunger strikers.\nHardly any of us know about each other, even though we are all protesting and taking actions for the same issues. As things stand at the moment, our actions are all unconnected. With this app that we’re still working to develop, we could have a centralized source where people can see all these things happening, and we could reach out to organizers in Alabama, Texas, New Jersey, bring them to the table and come out with the united front. All the issues are the same, so why are we not all acting and moving and organizing together?\nThere is just too much information and too much trickery going on for people to be on top of what is going on and who and what is legit or not. This app will help to centralize information and actions and allow us to strengthen and grow our base from which to inform and educate.\nWhen you look back to November 2017, you’ll see an article I wrote in the San Francisco Bay View for the Campaign to Redistribute the Pain 2018, where I presented the idea and laid out a potential structure building a nationwide, “Inside-led” organization called the National Freedom Movement (which is now growing). (tinyurl.com/y4yarmw4) The elevated levels of activity around the country today illustrate why having a national structure is so important, so that all of these campaigns can be organized and be happening simultaneously in several states. There are a lot of organizations involved in what’s going on in Alabama, New Jersey, Florida, so why can’t we all work together?\nWe can’t remain stuck in isolated borders when we are dealing with people who are committed to solving this gigantic problem. Prisons commissioners, police chiefs, mayors, doctors, and many other common groups, all have national meetings and platforms that they share every year. They are unified and they are together — that is why they are successful. We are not unified, and that’s why we are not successful!\nThere are many organizations on the outside supporting our struggle, but they already have their own agendas and plans that they organize around. The work they do for us falls within the context of the limited scope of what they are about. In other words, they are not structured exclusively to our needs and concerns.\nOutside organizations are coming in and offering help, but not helping us build our own infrastructure. When they leave, or the cause of the moment dies off, they take their resources and infrastructure with them. That model is only mildly effective.\nIf we are to have long-term success and truly solve these problems, then we’ll have to build our own nationwide, Inside-led outside-support network ourselves. And that starts with the Inside coming together nationally first.\nWhat I am proposing in the National Freedom Movement is that those of us on the inside come together and then organize our own outside-support organizations from the ground up: We provide the by-laws; we make the structure — and every component and every brick is set up by those of us on the inside.\nWe already have more than enough legit Inside-led organizations. The bottom line is we should be organizing together, planning together and dictating the action and the tempo nationwide from the inside. But we aren’t unified, and as a result, most — but not all — of our actions are reactive.\nFor those asking what they can do to help, help us build our own national infrastructure in the way we are describing. It’s paternalistic and destructive to the Movement to do otherwise. Over time, we see organizations pull out and take their resources with them, returning every now and then to play favorites amongst the Inside activists. They use their leverage and resources to play divide-and-conquer amongst inside factions. This benefits the government and not the struggle. That’s why we need our own outside-support structure. Without independence, we’ll always have these problems that we are having today with outside organizations.\nDC: Any final thoughts or words you want to speak about?\nBH: Starting out, this call was originally for a 30-day Economic Blackout in the form of work strikes, boycotts and protests. Over the past 4-to-5 days, however, we started to see the Economic Blackout aspect become overshadowed and hijacked. This was allowed to happen for a number of reasons — none of them positive.\nFor example, I am seeing an organization conducting a fundraiser “for the hunger strikers,” but with no offer of support for the others sacrificing. And, one of the reasons they say they are raising funds — to help pay for commissary — is a direct contradiction of the Economic Blackout. They say they are raising funds at the request of the Free Alabama Movement, but why would FAM be requesting funds to be spent in a way that directly contradicts the Economic Blackout?\nLost in the shuffle is the fact that the hunger strikers are taking action to support the Economic Blackout. Nevertheless, we have people reporting on the hunger strikers in a way that totally separates them from the Economic Blackout, where all freedom fighters are being called on to take action by quitting their jobs, rejecting visits and or foregoing canteen or incentive packages — and going on hunger strike if this is your choice.\nThese are obvious contradictions that compelled me to speak where I otherwise had been silent on certain matters. Supporters have to understand that their individual relationships and conversations don’t translate into universal support for FAM, and they should not be making statements and taking actions that cause contradictions or conflicts with overall Movement activities.\nWhen the message gets hijacked, the companies to boycott are being given a pass, and the potential to expand the boycott is being lost. But this is what happens when outside support organizations put personal relationships before organizational principles. They started picking the people they like and reporting from that angle, instead of supporting the cause. And that’s another reason why we need to create our own outside-support structure.\nWe need everyone to stay focused on our fundamental approach to defining and solving this problem with economic direct-action campaigns, because this is how we are going to affect change. We support everyone who is making a sacrifice for freedom and all of the families, but we have to remain vigilant in our understanding that this is a comprehensive plan, not a reactionary one.\nAnd it’s not just for 30 days. We want people to know that this is ongoing. We can’t let the State off the hook by forgetting that we are here to defund, divest and be disruptive with economic strategies and tactics. We’ll amplify that by any means necessary.\nBennu Hannibal Ra Sun is the founder of the Free Alabama Movement and Executive Director of the Campaign to Redistribute the Pain.

Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of the Federal Republic of Somalia to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (30.09.2022)\nOpinion: Kenyatta will miss his old office very quickly…\nIt has been announced that the former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has been appointed to mediate and be a “Special Envoy” to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Ethiopia. He will have to partake in the insurgencies in the DRC and the conflict in Northern Ethiopia (Tigray). Therefore, he has a massive take and lots of responsibility overnight.\nThe Former President be working with Heads of State in the DRC. Where he has to be working directly with the authorities in Kinshasa. That’s the place he has a shot and possibility to make a difference. Kenyatta already has a working relationship with President Felix Tshisekedi. Therefore, if there is hope for any substantial progress or delivery. He should hope to get somewhere in the DRC.\nThe M23 latest peace agreement was already made in Nairobi with the Nairobi Declaration. That’s why, Kenyatta has goodwill and could use the working relations from his years in office to make a difference, but we shouldn’t have to high hopes. However, we have to take what positives there are before downplaying this role and office.\nOn the other hand, in Ethiopia and Addis Ababa, is a place where Kenyatta might not be so much welcome. There won’t be much fanfare or acceptance of him. He will be a nonce and nuisance quickly. The Addis Ababa government have to already work with the African Union Envoy for the Horn, Olusegun Obasanjo. The former Nigerian President have struggled to bring any dialogue or talks between the stakeholders. This work has been stifled and his had an unforgiving role, as the FDRE and the Government of Tigray has both ceased talks or negotiations in general.\nObasanjo have tried and his hands are tied. We know the FDRE is directing how the AU Envoy can operate. While people will quickly question the mandate and what sort of mission Kenyatta has. This was quickly launched, as Kenyatta retired from the Office of Presidency. It is a way of softening the blow and give him a purpose. Though, what will the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tell Kenyatta and what is his anticipated to do?\nWill he make phone-calls, conduct field-work or even try to get stakeholders to meet each other? A man of peace can do a lot. He can do little or a lot. If any of the 10 years in Office will tell us. The former President could easily create a scandal or a way of using the office for enriching himself. However, it would be hard to find a way to make this happen. Nevertheless, people shouldn’t be shocked, if he found a way or a scheme to get some additional funds. That is his way and how he has run his government.\nRuto surely sent him on his merry. Giving him a token of appreciation and an honourable task. Kenyatta should use all diplomatic channels and shouldn’t expect much. It isn’t like his through IGAD, AU or any other body. No, his just appointed by the incumbent Kenyan President and that isn’t setting a strong mandate.\nThis is sort of like the mandate or role Stephan Kalonzo Musyoka had in the South Sudan in the previous term. He was the Special Envoy to South Sudan and he surely cannot show much, if anything He got a few free trips to Juba, but cannot be said to helped the process significantly.\nThis here office should be gazetted and the mandate should be set forward. Also, the current President should give a time-frame and possible plans for it. Since, it shouldn’t just be something to keep Kenyatta busy. Kenyatta should have a target to work towards in coordination with Kinshasa and Addis Ababa. However, time will tell if they will let him or see him as outside noise.

The government taking part in the initiative of the parties organized meetings where the modalities and process of the National dialogue was discussed. However, while the discussions were in progress and the stakeholders were debating the best way to organize the national dialogue, the government unilaterally prepared a bill regulating the process and passed it through the one party dominated parliament ignoring the concerns of the political parties.\nThen, the government, exacerbating the matter further, started a dubious process of selecting the commission that will facilitate the National dialogue violating the fundamental principles of a national dialogue which are inclusivity in all facets of the process by all key stakeholders. Furthermore, no provision was put in place to allow commission to reach out to those who are currently banned and are at war with the government.\nCOP strongly believes that the current toxic political environment that resulted in bloody wars, economic decline and further polarization of the differences between all political forces, including the government could only be resolved through genuine, inclusive National dialogue where all stakeholders are fully engaged and given a chance to take active part in the solution.\nHaving seen how the National Dialogue process was compromised and misdirected, COP members decided to question their participating in a current format of the National Dialogue and present an alternative formula for organizing a genuine National dialogue in order to confront the culture of conspiratorial politics and heralding political actions that would positively contribute to the development of democratic culture and dissuade the government in a constructive way from taking a wrong direction.\nTherefore, COP proposes that The National dialogues intended to address the key issues facing the politico/social and Economic landscape today shall meet the minimum of international standards and practices in order to give the process a chance to succeed include the followings:\nAn immediate, real cessation of hostilities and Internationally monitored ceasefire in all areas in Ethiopia including Tigray, Afar and Amhara, in Northern Ethiopia, Oromia , Benishangul, and Somali States.\nAssurance by the government that it and key stakeholders take steps to restructure a commission and the edit regulating the process in a way that makes the process inclusive, representative and genuine, whereby negotiating parties have a strong support base, credible claim of legitimacy in representing their constituency, the political will and the ability to implement what was agreed upon including shared responsibility of implementation of the outcome of the National dialogue.\nIn order to ensure transparency, independence and inclusiveness of the commission members, political parties shall have a meaningful presence in the commission and take part in the process and criteria of selection. In addition, any discriminatory clause shall be removed from selection criteria such as holding only Ethiopian passports for people of Ethiopian origin in order to benefit from their expertise.\nIn the agenda setting process, there shall be a clear and transparent process that accommodates agenda presentation and approval by all stakeholders without discrimination.\nSince Ethiopia is not an Island in this intricately interconnected global world and every decision we make is important to the other countries. Therefore, we demand provision that permit involvement and engagement of credible, neutral facilitators or mediators from the international community take part in the National dialogue process when deemed necessary.\nTransparent and agreed upon decision making process including consensus and mediation shall be agreed by upon by all key stakeholders.\nAdequate confidence building measures, including supplying security of key participants, effective international oversight, release of all political prisoners and lifting of embargo on humanitarian aid to those who are in desperate need of food and medicine.\nIt’s in the best interest of our people to give a guarantee and safety of all participants in the process and transparent security arrangements whereby Opposition parties leaders are not threatened by harassment, imprisonment and/or extra judicial killings.\nMember Parties\n1.

Situated on a sprawling 503 hectares of land at Yeka Hill, in Yeka Sub-city, the construction touches five woredas, which will harbor the construction of halls, lakes, housing units and road infrastructures, among other facilities. Part of the government’s 10 year perspective plan, the project will see the evacuation of thousands of people. However, the residents will be given a chance to develop their own property on their land, if it fits the standard of the area, where the palace will be built. Sources told The Reporter the UAE government will contribute a portion of the budget needed to construct the palace” (The Ethiopian Reporter – ‘Government inches to build palace for over 49 billion birr’ 21.05.2022).\nIt seems to be official that the ruler of Addis Ababa and beyond, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali is planning to change his estate and his residence. As there are now plans to spend about a $1 billion United States Dollar on building a new Palace. That will be instead of residing in the Menelik Palace and the Grand Jubilee, which will become a museums.\nThe OPM and the ruling regime is prioritizing building a lavish Palace for their ruler. Instead of spending money on food security, agriculture or anything that can help the citizens. Because, the state has created a famine in Northern parts of the Republic. While it is having severe droughts in the Ogaden and surrounding areas. It is also possible hurt and suffering in the Afar region and parts of the Amhara region after warfare last year. Also, we have no estimation or idea of the damage, the pain or suffering in the Oromia region as well. Therefore, the state isn’t creating sustainable mechanisms or programs. Instead they are choosing to build a magnificent building for the Prime Minister to reside in.\nThe state who just received $300 million USD to “rebuild” and “retool” parts of the war-torn regions of the Republic. As the Republic is having a rising inflation hitting around the 40% rise. While also lacking foreign exchange. Meanwhile the Federal Government has also invested and imported more weaponry, tanks and other equipment to further their internal conflicts. Therefore, there is no shadow of doubt. That things will only get worse… before they get better.\nAs the famines, droughts and steady arrival of conflicts. The use of war to silence to silence dissent and opposition. While spending fortunes on prestige projects like the Palace of the PM. That just shows what sort of mismatched priorities the PM has and he has no ideal of how it is wrecking the economy.\nIn the last budget the state used 12 billion birrs on food security, 17 billion birrs on job creation, 33 billion birrs on health care and 16 billion birrs on education. So, you can easily see how the Federal Government is prioritizing the Palace over all the other necessities. Yes, some funds will come from the UAE Government, but that’s still a waste of government spending. This is not for developing the Republic or helping the citizens in need. No, this is just to boost the ego of man and his lofty ambitions.\nAbiy wants so badly to be seen as a King and be a monarch. Now, his building a grand palace in his name and during his tenure. That just shows his intentions and he has no scruples either. As his government is waging war, been blocking humanitarian aid and been vicious against any critics within his realm.\nNow… his starting to build a Palace and soon his trying to figure out who can make him a crown. Peace.\nAuthor nilspeacePosted on May 22, 2022 May 22, 2022 Categories Africa, Development, Economy, Governance, Government, Law, Leadership, PoliticsTags Abiy, Abiy Ahmed, Abiy Ahmed Ali, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Ethiopian Prosperity Party, FDRE, Finfinne, Menelik Palace, PM Abiy, Prosperity PartyLeave a comment on Ethiopia: PM Abiy wants a Palace fitted for a King\nEthiopia: The Federal Government is cracking down on all critical media…\nThe latest arrest is now Meskerem Abera, the journalist who has also just been abducted at Addis Abeba airport earlier today on the 21st May 2022. She is following a long line of government critics who has been apprehended, arrested and taken to unknown location. In addition to that, another kidnapping and arrest is of Tadious Tantu as well. Who has been gone missing since yesterday.\nThis is a grand scale of going after anyone who isn’t following the Federal Government line in the media. That is very obvious, because this a broad-net of journalists taken into custody over the last 48 hours.\nHere is some brief reports of others arrested as well.\n“The Amhara region based Ashara media outlet announced that police arrested 5 of its staff last night & that it cannot establish their whereabouts today. The five are Kelemu Gelagay, Daniel Mesfin (editors/cameramen), Gashaye Negussie, Getnet Yalew, Habtamu Melese (reporters)” (Zecharias Zelalem, 20.05.2022).\n“News has just broken that Solomon Shumiye current affairs talk show host with a decent following on the Gebeyanu YouTube channel, has just been taken into police custody. We’re at about 10 media staffers detained across Ethiopia in just the past 24 hours” (Zecharias Zelalem, 20.05.2022).\nEarlier in the month another arrest was also done:\n“Journalist Gobeze Sisay accused Ethiopia Government of crackdown on dissent media\n✅Gobeze says his arrest is similar to the Tamerat Negera case, where Oromia police censor media, claiming “Oromophobia”\n✅Tamera is #Oromo but opposes ethnic-federalism policy of Abiy’s OPP” (Awasa Guardian, 10.05.2022).\nWe can easily see that this is deliberate acts of silencing everyone and only get out the message of the state. A way of taking away anyone who speaks, thinks or even considers to question Prime Minster Abiy Ahmed Ali and his Prosperity Party. His party and Federal Government is aiming at anyone who blinks their eyes twice and thinks about questioning his actions.\nThat’s why these mass-arrests are happening. The sudden kidnappings of journalists, activists, civic leaders and advocates are targeted as well. This is all deliberated and by taking out the journalists the media will not report on it and neither will there be a media who questions these violations of people’s rights.\nThe PM and his party can rule with their tyranny, as there is no voices of reason. There is only incarceration and detention of anyone who dissent. The government is certainly showing it’s vicious side and instead of settling grievances with words. They are instead using it’s authority to silence it’s critics. That is not a shocker, as unity is spread to the sound of guns and ammo. Therefore, it follows a pattern of violence as a means of solidifying power.

Trying to recruit Ethiopian Youth, Russians do not tell anybody that as of April 18, 2022, over 20000 of RU invaders has already met their Death in Ukraine. Felt defeated in Ukraine, Russia insidiously tries to mislead and play its dirty games” (Embassy of Ukraine in Ethiopia, 18.04.2022).\nToday in Addis Ababa there been long lines and queues outside of the Russian Embassy. As there are reports of a total of 2000 Ethiopian citizens that has signed up to fight on the Russian side of the Ukrainian conflict.\nThat is only mere reports that has been refuted by the Russians, but they are willing to lie about everything. While the Ukrainian Embassy in Addis Ababa says they are recruiting. The Ukrainians are the ones who is defending their territory and nation against the Russian-Belorussian invasion, which has lasted for over 50 days now.\nIt is very unique, if these Ethiopians join this war. This isn’t a world war and neither is a conflict that has spiralled outside of the borders of Ukraine. No, for now it is a Russian-Belarus-Ukraine thing for the most part. The Russians warns everyone else of not to move, think or coordinate. While the Russians has already gotten Syrian mercenaries and could easily try to conscript Ethiopians to fight their battles.\nThere is already reports that the Russians needs reinforcement badly. As on Job-Sites and Work-Offerings the Ministry of Defence is offering unique and patriotic-based contracts for the ones who is willing to sacrifice and fight for Russia in Ukraine. The Russian Federation and it’s army needs recruits. That is evident after all the losses and the total failure of the swift invasion, which was supposed to happen within 48 hours or three days…\nHowever, here we are and Ethiopians are queueing outside the Embassy. Some is said to have with them a passport and documents to prepare visa’s and signing up to participate in the conflict. That means Ethiopians would fight on the Russian side of the conflict.\nThe ones that queueing today is supposed to part of Amhara Para-Military Group “Fano” which is supported by Amhara Regional State and been vital in the war against Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). Fano is the extremist and fascists of Ethiopia who has fought for Amharian supremacy and a Greater Amhara. So, they will fit well in with the Z brigade of Moscow and be in-line quickly with the Russian propaganda of Kremlin. Therefore, if that is true. It is a match made in Hell and not in Heaven.\nNevertheless, the Ethiopian mercenaries or conscripts is signing up for a war that isn’t theirs in the first place. They will not be honoured and be respected for their efforts. These will be cannon-fodder and die like flies on the front-line. The Ethiopian soldiers will not conquer or overcome Ukrainian forces. They will only be a temporary fix and a possible strategy of cutting the losses of the Russians own brigades.\nThe Ethiopian Youth and “Fano” might see this as a possible way of training, expertise and a possible pay-check. They rather fight a war far away and get credit for it. In such a way of leaving desperation at home to flee to “greener” pasture in Eastern Europe. However, they will bleed and die for nothing. The Russian will not honour their sacrifice or write tales of glory for their participation. No, they are just useful pawns on the chess-set and the first to catch a bullet for them.\nThe Ethiopian mercenaries will not linger much hope. When the Russians themselves has struggled and lead to many tactical defeats for the last 50 days. Why would Ethiopians make a huge difference? No, I don’t think so. Not because they are not warriors and cannot fight a battle. No, it is because of the conflict they would enter and the enemy they are meeting. It is not like it will be easy and be friendly. No, it will be brutal and they spare no one. Especially, the soldiers and the ones who is representing Russian invasion force.\nThat’s because the Ethiopian or “Fano” will be part of the invaders and an invasion. They are not part of the defence or the ones who is defending their homeland. No, they are going after Ukraine and on Ukrainian soil. That is a death wish and they will not return home as heroes. They are joining an imperial power and partaking in unjustified war. This is why nothing good will come out of it.\nThe ones signing up for this… is signing up for a death sentence and Moscow will not repay them. They are just taking a bullet for Kremlin and no love will ever be lost. These youths and Ethiopians will not return or be able to tell about the war they entered. Because, the Russians wouldn’t spare them. They are the ones they can risk and send to the front-line without any costs. Since, they signed up for it and they got to fight. There will be no option to flee or seek shelter. No, they are there to fight the cause of Russia.\nA cause that will end up in caskets or not even that. They will be left behind on the battlefield and forgotten. A bloodshed and a sacrifice of a willing. Youth and Amhara militia members who fought a war that wasn’t theirs. The tears and losses will be felt by their families and loved ones. Who knew that they went and never heard from them again. Families and villages who saw their sons leave for war in Eastern Europe. Where they never returned from and only got a mantle or a signed off on war-grave. However, they will not return with stories of greatness or of adventures. No, they will be scorn, torn and bleed for a conflict, which wasn’t theirs and never will be theirs to begin with. They will be the lost souls and the sons of far away who could have lived life in peace and created a future in Ethiopia. Instead they sought after glory and a pay-off from Russia. A pay-off they will not receive. Since most of them will die before the Russian Federation or Ministry of Defence has to even care about their salaries. Peace.\nBTW: It would make a difference, if the Amhara or Ethiopians joined the Ukrainian side either. This is a war for the soul of Europe and a war against European imperialism. Where the NATO/EU and Russia are on each side. As the Ukrainian are fighting for its own independence and sovereignty to join whatever entity or alliance it see fit. While Russians wants to have control of their neighbours. Which is why there is no natural reason or argument to defend the participation of Ethiopian Youth or “Fano” in either sides of the conflict in Ukraine. They will not be remembered or written tales of glory. No, they are mercenaries who will die in unmarked graves, which is undignified for their sacrifice, but an end, which is most likely to happen.\nBTW II: Don’t say nobody didn’t warn you or didn’t write about it.

There is a pending corruption case, which questions missing funds $50 million, which was misused and not spent as promised on agricultural equipment from Poland. Therefore, an old case is suddenly appearing and haunting the former Prime Minister.\nWhen these sorts of things happens years after. As we have seen the succession of Abiy and the years in power. This seems like a sting and operation to take down a former ally who paved the way for Abiy to get into office. That is how it seems to me.\nThe money is most likely eaten and the ones in office is doing the same. If not they are misusing funds to combat it’s own people and asking for donors for military equipment to kill their own. Surely, the former PM have to answer for his own grievances.\nHowever, this is a political game, as Abiy is safe and has the throne. He feels superior and untouchable, as the warfare haven’t hit home and neither has the crippling economy. So, as long as the gig is working. He can focus on consolidating all power and this way go after someone who can put him in a bad light.\nWhich just happens to be the former Prime Minister. A man who did the noble thing and resigned after failing. A PM stepping down after misusing his office and suspending the rights of his people. Using the Command Post and the State of Emergency to further the plight of the demonstrating youths. Alas, the former PM did the graceful thing and bowed out.\nNevertheless, Abiy rather silence and get rid of his critics. That’s why this fits a pattern and now he seeks a former ally and a predecessor. In such a way to silence and stop him too. To use the past and the courts to go after him. It is just so fitting and a political move, as the same courts has been used against high profiled opposition. Therefore, we know the drill and the motivation for it now.\nJust like Abiy have gone after and gotten rid of the ones that made him like Lemma Megersa. It seems like he has put the target on Hailemariam now. The one who was before him and to signal that anyone can be touched. That is how it seems… and it wouldn’t be shocking. As there are plenty of political prisoners lingering in jail and the former PM would maybe even join fellow jailbirds who he put behind bars during his reign.\nTherefore, this is just a sign of cleaning the house and furthering his consolidating of power, which is a enterprise, which doesn’t seem to slow down. However, it just takes new forms and the PM isn’t done with doing so.

This is not the first time an African Warlord or President with conflicts is hiring lobbyist to “clean-up” their image abroad. It is all done to sway the U.S. Congress and get a favourable tune from the White House. Because, the broken Washington D.C. is for sale and everyone can be bought, apparently.\nVenable LLP had 81 clients in 2020 and spent $7,400,000 in lobbying fees for various of causes. The Venable LLP had 44 lobbyist working for them last year.\nWhat is striking is the two fellas that is representing Ethiopia in Washington D.C. is Thomas Quinn and Loren Aho. Open Secrets says Quinn speciality is Taxation by a vast margin and Defence. While Aho have also Defence as speciality. This is not government affairs or foreign affairs, which is where the Ethiopian government needs help to sway public opinion about the war in Tigray and all the other atrocities across the Republic.\nOn a FARA form filed by Quinn on the 4th February 2021. Quinn is an attorney and a partner in the company. It states that he has three foreign principals his working for as a foreign agent. In his filing, these are: “Embassy of Ethiopia, Embassy of the State of Qatar & Hong Kong Trade Development Council”. This means that works for these others as well. While banking the thousands of dollars per month from Addis Ababa. We can wonder how much Qatar and HKDC is paying him too.\nThe Ethiopian Embassy is paying Venable LLP US$35,000 per month. When they have a taxation expert and minor lobbyist on his payroll. The company has an outreach and has a big team. Though, the two who is handling this has this history. This is information in the public domain from ProPublica and OpenSecrets. It is not like the American lobbyists isn’t looked into, as a public oversight to their actions and how they influence U.S. Congress.\nThat Quinn and Aho is hired to this is to whitewash and make Abiy’s government look good in the public eye in the US. It is to get Committee’s to act in favour of Addis Ababa. That is why they have hired these fellows. Where they are trying to sway and swing things in their direction. So, that they are not sanctioned or embargoed in any way. Especially, now that they are going into an election, warfare in Tigray and other lingering conflicts across the Republic.\nPrime Minister Abiy has hired these guys to look good. That is the reason. As his team isn’t able to get positive headlines in Western Media and the use of this as a platform to get that. This is why regimes like this uses lobbyists to become “cleansed” from the “bloodstains” abroad. Also, to ensure their leadership and legitimacy across the board. In a manner, which they get vouched for by the International Community.\nIt is ironic that Abiy does this, as he holds a grip on local-media and accreditation of foreign media houses too. Just give people a pass, if they follows his guidelines and writes his stories. If they don’t, then they are banished from the Republic.

Roosjen is officially a pre-historical human being, he is back-to-future, he is the mirage and the answers of all things. Since he can patent something that has been part of Ethiopian culture and their practices, without their consent and without consideration. He is not the owner of Teff Flour. The United States Patent Office shouldn’t accept this, because this is taking someones national pride and food culture and stamping their ill-gotten name on it.\nThis is a mockery of invention, this is cultural and staple food theft. It would be like stealing french-fries from Belgium, the Kimchi from South Korea or the Feijoada from Brazil. No one owns that invention, but you cannot patent it too. This is made for the people and owned by the people, secondly, as a foreigner you should appreciate the culture, not steal it. That is what this man has done with the Patent of Teff Flour milling. Like he invented it, he didn’t invent it, he just served a document and filing to the Patent Office. They should have dismissed it as a insane thinking of a European man, who has no ownership to the food cuisine of Ethiopia.\nTeff History:\n“Teff (Eragrostis Tef) is a cereal crop of Poaceae or Gramineae family with small grains. It is believed to have originated in Ethiopia between 4000 and 1000 BC [1]. Teff seeds were reported to be discovered in a pyramid which is thought to date back to 3359 BC [1]. It is a primarily cultivated cereal crop in Ethiopia with high market price and socio-economic values. Its center of origin and diversity is Ethiopia” (…) “The cultivation of teff as a major cereal crop in Ethiopia was started thousands of years ago. As mentioned in the Introduction, some researchers have indicated that teff production in Ethiopia has a history of more than 4000 years. Teff is a primarily cultivated cereal crop in Ethiopia with high market price and socio-economic values” (Daba, 2017).\nEncyclopedia of Life (eol.org) states this:\n“Between 8,000 and 5,000 BC, the people of the Ethiopian highlands were among the first to domesticate plants and animals for food and teff was one of the earliest plants domesticated.[4] Teff is believed to have originated in Ethiopia and Eritrea between 4,000 BCE and 1,000 BCE. Genetic evidence points to E. pilosa as the most likely wild ancestor.[5] A 19th century identification of teff seeds from an ancient Egyptian site is now considered doubtful; the seeds in question (no longer available for study) are more likely of E. aegyptiaca, a common wild grass in Egypt.[6]” (eol.org – ‘Eragrostis tef’).\nThat Roosjen own business, which is on his page teff-grain.com, where he states: “given the fall-numbers the mixing of teff-grain or flour with other flours/seeds is patented”. That is very insane, that a man from Netherlands or Holland is thieving a 1000 year old tradition and trying to keep it to himself. That is disgusting, it would be okay if he imported it through Prograin, the company he is owns and serves, but patenting it, is taking it a bit to far.\nSo the Roosjen started a shop in 2004, patent it in 2006 and has forgotten the tradition of the food. It is time for the world to patent everything for Nethlands, the wind-mills and when coming to foods. It is time for Ethiopians to patent Dutch tradition food, to retaliate like Pannenkoeken, Erwtensoep, Poffertjes and Stroopwafels. Because if a random Dutch man can patent food for centuries and get away it. The Ethiopian and government, should do similar acts until the Dutch retract this nonsense. This is demeaning and insulting of all humanity. Its like patenting human life itself, Roosjen next project could be to patent one of the pyramids of Egypt. Since he could already has stolen, the pride and staple food of injeera of Ethiopia.\nRoosjen, you do not own an African Cuisine, you don’t have the rights to patent 8000-year old tradition food from Ethiopia. How dear you, you should retract it and be glad to mother, that you can still import this food and the flour itself. The Ethiopian partners of yours should stop selling to you. Since, you have betrayed their tradition and their cuisine, they should boycott you and yours families business.\nA Dutch Company and a Dutch Man is lucky to be able to trade the commodity, they should sanction the man. The farmers, the traders in Addis Ababa, the ones who has traded with his company and the ones licensing sale to him. Should stop immediately, he doesn’t deserve it. Because he has stolen part of the pride of Ethiopia. No one has the right to do so. No-One has the right to do so, it is insulting and demeaning.\nDaba, Tadessa – ‘Nutritional and Soio-Cultural Values of Teff (Eragrostis tef) in Ethiopia’ (May 2017)\nAuthor nilspeacePosted on March 25, 2018 March 25, 2018 Categories Africa, Business, Civil Service, Development, Ethics, Governance, Government, Law, Leadership, Trade, TransparencyTags Eragrostis Tef, Ethiopia, FDRE, Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, Food Culture, glutenvrijmeel, GoE, Government of Ethiopia, Heritage, Horn of Africa, Injeera, Injera, Prograin, Staple Food, Teff, Teff Flour, Teff Seeds, Teff-Grain-Com, Tradition2 Comments on Teff-Flour Patent Belongs to Ethiopia: Sanction Roosjen and his businesses now!","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line589722"}

Launched at the end of October, the campaign calls on the Government to confirm a date for a constitutional referendum on the public ownership of water services. The campaign is supported by Fórsa, SIPTU, Unite, Connect and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.\nSpeaking at the campaign launch, ICTU president and Fórsa general secretary, Kevin Callinan, said the campaign to name the date for a referendum represented a shared commitment by trade unions to ensure the future of public ownership of water services: “It’s time now to end any lingering uncertainty about the future of water services in Ireland. A referendum would give people the opportunity to have their say, in addition to providing us all with a unique opportunity to safeguard public ownership of water for future generations.\n“In that sense, there should be no further hesitation, and we are urging the Government now to name the date. In doing so, it would be taking a welcome and positive step,” he said.\nPublic ownership of water services ensures safe and sustainable access to water for everyone.\nAssistant general secretary Catherine Keogh, who has been working closely with Fórsa members in local authorities providing water services, has said the feeling among members is very strong: “They want the Government to name the date for a referendum, to clearly indicate when we can expect to cast a vote to protect the future of our water services. That feeling is universal, so I expect we’ll see strong support for this campaign,” she said.\nFórsa’s head of Local Government Richy Carrothers said the unions had come together to maximise participation in the campaign by union members: “Privatised water services result in higher costs and poorer services for the public. Public ownership of water services ensures safe and sustainable access to water for everyone.\n“A referendum would help protect Irish water services from any future attempt at privatisation, providing a constitutional guarantee of public ownership. Opinion polls show that a huge majority of the Irish public want a referendum to ensure water services can never be privatised.\n“We’re inviting all union branches and members to take part in this campaign by signing the petition and talking to their local political representatives about naming a date for this important referendum.\n“This is the kind of grassroots campaign that unions excel at, and I’m confident that Fórsa members will seize the opportunity to get this message across to the Government parties,” he said.\nYou can sign the petition here and Fórsa members are encouraged to circulate the link among work colleagues, friends and family to seek their support for the campaign.\nThere’s never been a better time to join a union, and it’s never been easier.

This rationale underlies the Stimson Doctrine that was used as a justification for states not to recognise the annexation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union. This rationale is also expressed in the International Law Commission’s Article 41 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility. The obligation is a norm of customary international law and aims at preventing that a violation of international law becomes validated by means of recognition. It contains a “minimum resistance” and “a continuous challenge to a legal wrong”. The obligation arises where a territorial entity has been created in violation of an erga omnes norm, especially by violating the prohibition of the use of force, by violating the right to self-determination, or by violating the prohibition of systematic racial discrimination.\nThe “Treaty on the Accession of the Republic of Crimea to the Russian Federation” was referred to the Constitutional Court on 18 March 2014 at 17:00.16 The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation issued a unanimous judgment (the opinion) on the constitutionality of this “Treaty” in less than a day after the “Treaty” was referred to it (actually within one night), i.e. 19 March 2014. 17 Such procedural expediency (dealing with the case actually per night) is not common for any Court, including the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, and raises a reasonable doubt about the independence of the Russian Constitutional Court in dealing with the requested opinion.\nOn-the-role-of-the-constitutional-court-of-the-Russian-federation-in-the-annexation-of-Crimea\nOn 21 March 2014, the Russian Federation annexed the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. This occurred after a series of events which took place in less than a month, and in which the Russian armed forces were clearly involved. The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation received a request for an opinion on the constitutionality of the treaty on the incorporation of Crimea on 18 March 2014, and issued its opinion on the very next day, on 19 March 2014. The annexation of Crimea was completed on 21 March 2014. The Court’s opinion was a direct instrument facilitating the internal legalisation of the annexation of part of the Ukrainian territory, which is an international crime. That is an unprecedented event, since, for the first time in history, the whole constitutional court was used for the commission of the gravest international crime – the crime of aggression.\nInternational Consensus regarding the Illegality of the Annexation of Crimea\nThe occupation and annexation of Crimea were denounced by the international community as a grave breach of the ius cogens obligation of non-use of force (i.e. aggression). Such a breach triggers a corresponding international obligation erga omnes not to recognise the purported statehood of an effective territorial entity created in violation of the fundamental norm of international law, as well as not to recognise any territorial acquisition that is a result of that breach.\non-the-role-of-the-constitutional-court-of-the-russian-federation-in-the-annexation-of-crimeaDownload\nTags: 2014CE Constitutional Courts Russia\nPrevious: Constitutional Court of Ukraine initiates suspension of membership of Constitutional Courts of Russia and Belarus in WCCJ-04/03/2022\nNext: Remarks by Indian PM at 2nd India-Australia Virtual Summit-21/03/2022","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1781936"}

It is promising to see that the Plan emphasises the role that education can play in building social cohesion and promoting national unity. Improving the quality of education across the country will be fundamental in eliminating poverty and reducing inequality over the next two decades.\nThe Plan acknowledges that inadequate school infrastructure continues to plague the education system. It calls for the infrastructure backlogs to be addressed so as to meet the “basic infrastructure and equipment standards set by the National Department of Basic Education”. However, the Plan’s call to address the lack of basic infrastructure appears to be founded on the mistaken belief that binding “basic infrastructure and equipment standards” exist and have been set by the Department. EE recommends that the Plan call for the enactment of binding regulations governing minimum norms and standards for school infrastructure as the first step in addressing the school infrastructure crisis. The Plan should also set its own vision of what facilities should be provided to learners. EE’s recently launched court case against Angie Motshekga has highlighted the Departments failure to set binding norms and standards. Without such norms and standards, any proposal to remedy South Africa’s school infrastructure crisis will fail to prove successful.\nThe Plan has highlighted the plight of rural schools in South Africa. Rural schools continue to endure the consequences of chronic poverty and a critical shortage of qualified teachers. The difficult working environments often found in rural schools result in teachers leaving these posts and discourage teachers from taking up these posts. The Plan suggests that teacher bursary schemes be “strengthened and expanded” and measures be put in place to ensure “graduates are immediately absorbed into schools”. However, the Plan is silent on how to attract quality teachers to rural schools. EE recommends that an incentive structure should be introduced that sufficiently incentivises teachers to take up and continue to stay in rural teaching posts. These could include increased remuneration and accommodation and travel allowances.\nEE values the opportunity to assist the NPC in shaping South Africa’s national planning strategy as it relates to the improvement of basic education. EE believes that if its recommendations are incorporated, the Plan will go a long way towards achieving the 2030 vision of quality education for all.\nEE’s submission can be found online.\nFor more information please contact Lisa Draga (EELC Attorney) on 072 650 0214 or Yoliswa Dwane (EE Head of Policy, Communication and Research) on 072 342 7747\nCarla GoldsteinEqual Education Submits Recommendations for the Proposed National Development Plan 06.12.2012","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1118517"}

Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm — not all — that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\nThis question grabbed my attention for many reasons. My wife and I just returned from Asia. We were there for many reasons, but one of them involved a young Chinese woman precious to us. She was struggling to truly believe that God was really there for her. The question also grabbed my attention because I know that many influential people are going to be chatting, Tweeting, and Facebooking about what Gates said.\nFor this precious young lady, three key messages of Genesis chapters 1 and 2 were important for her to consider and ultimately believe:\nScience really can't answer the source or origin for matter and energy — something to which Gates alludes in his interview. Genesis says matter, energy, and life go back to the Creator and his desire to create.\nScience has a hard time coming up with a plausible answer about order out of chaos since everything in our world suggests that chaos devolves from order — entropy rules. Genesis claims that God brought order, specificity, and purpose out of chaos.\nHumanity wonders if there is anything that sets us apart from all other creatures — and yes, we are creatures (created beings) according to Scripture, but those in whom resides the image of God (Genesis 1:26-27). Genesis says God made us to have relationship with us and for us to have relationship with each other.\nWhile we have found all sorts of things to argue about in these first two chapters of the Bible, those three claims that lie behind Genesis chapters 1 and 2 are powerful messages — really startling claims — that God is behind everything that matters and that is precious to our lives as humans.\nFor this young woman so precious to us, each of these was a bit hard to grasp since she was raised to not believe in any religion — that things happened \"naturally.\" The only problem was, \"naturally\" could only take you so far and then you were left with your own leap of faith to believe something happened somehow, to start everything we know and bring order out of the mess it began with, and then somehow we ended up as people... all by random chance and accident, with no clear way of knowing how it all began — a beginning without the Beginning-Maker, order without the Orderer, and creation without the Creator.\nHowever, the statement Gates shared that intrigued me most is this one:\nI think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.\nThis question is the question I wish more of us who say we believe in God — and believe his incarnation in Jesus — would ponder. It's the \"Now, so what?\" question that I've spent the last 37 years of ministry trying to get people to ask for themselves.\nWe live in a time of interior religion — very much a part of our Western culture individualism. We also live in a time when religious people are basically told, \"Be nice, stay out of the way, and please keep our mouths shut in public.\" So I will be a bit of a contrarian, or at least a thought-provoker, within my own cultural tribe, the God-believers. I challenge us to ask that \"Now, so what?\" question a lot more and let our answer make an intentional difference in how we choose to live. Too many of us are running around spouting our opinions about all sorts of things. What I'd like to see more is what an old professor of mine used to call \"putting your life where your mouth is.\"\nSo you believe in Jesus? Well, that's good, \"Now, so what?\" How do you live differently? How do you show the Jesus lifestyle in your own life? Oh, you haven't really read much of Jesus' story, you are just going by what you heard from someone else or thought you already knew? Hmm. Wouldn't it be good to go read a little about what Jesus said and did since we are given four different accounts of his life, words, and teaching? Then after spending some time with Jesus, start asking \"Now, so what\" about...\nthe way you treat your spouse?\nthe way you treat your kids?\nthe way you treat your employees or boss or coworkers or managers or...?\nthe way you choose how you spend your money?\nthe way you choose to look at people of different cultures and races?\n\"I think it makes sense to believe in God and I've made these changes and set these goals for my life.\"\nthe way you view truth, morality, goodness, and virtue?\nthe way you treat the poor, the disenfranchised, the left out, the voiceless, the vulnerable, the widow, the foreigner, the ill, your enemies, the old, and the young?\nThe \"Now, so what?\" question is the question begging to be answered — answered with changes in our lives because we believe Jesus stated and demonstrated the truth of God; truth we are going to do our best to live!\nWhy all this fuss? Why, Phil, is this such a big deal to you? Why burn a couple minutes of my life that I can never get back having me read this?\nBecause everything that matters in the end depends on what you and I do with our \"Now, so what?\" questions.\nHow do I know? Well, remember how Jesus ended his challenging teaching we call \"The Sermon on the Mount\"? It's the parable of the wise and foolish builder (Matthew 7:24-27). According to Jesus, the wise man whose house stood firm in the storm is the person who \"hears these words of mine and puts them into practice\" (Matthew 7:24). In other words, they ask the \"Now, so what?\" question and adjust their lives accordingly. And the foolish person? The one whose world can't stand up in the storm? Surely it's the one who doesn't believe, right? Not in this case. The foolish person according to Jesus is \"everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice\" (Matthew 7:26). Jesus' message goes in one ear and out the other. The message of Jesus never moves beyond data transfer. They never get around to asking the \"Now, so what?\" question.\nSo I want to challenge each of us — those of us who claim to follow Jesus — to ask the \"Now, so what?\" question. Let's go read a gospel* this next week. And then let's get practical with it. Let's ask the \"Now, so what?\" question as we read, remember, and think about Jesus' words and his example.\nSooner or later, we are going to need to be able to say, \"I think it makes sense to believe in God and I've made these changes and set these goals for my life because I learned them from 'Immanuel,' God with us\" (Matthew 1:23).\n* The four gospels are the first four books in the New Testament, called Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. They tell the story of Jesus' life from a little different point of view shared with people who had challenges that could be answered by the life, words, and example of Jesus.\nFrom 'Now What?' to 'What's Next'\nCreation Receives a Soul\nGod's Good Creation\n\"Now, so what?\" by Phil Ware is licensed under a Creative Commons License.

This has led to a situation in which fracking is currently considered a controversial technique for extracting natural gas. While tapping into these vast resources is something many people are in favor of, the concerns center on what the process of fracking may be doing to the environment.\nHowever, there are many benefits of fracking and utilizing it to access these deposits of natural gas and oil. One of the benefits is the ability for the United States to extend its supply of natural gas, which is used in many aspects of the energy industry, including home heating. Of all the fossil fuels, natural gas is the cleanest to burn, the most efficient, and the least costly. For these reasons, many newly built electric generation plants are turning to natural gas for fuel, rather than coal, creating increased demand for natural gas.\nIn Focus: How Hydraulic Fracturing Works\nIn addition to the ability to extend and use this large supply of natural gas, fracking operations can help develop the communities where plays are located. For example, according to Chevron, operators of fracking wells at the Marcellus play in Pennsylvania, this play generated $11.2 billion in what Chevron calls, “regional equivalent of gross domestic product,” and it contributed $1.1 billion to state and local tax revenues. Chevron says Marcellus also supported nearly 140,000 jobs. Fracking has become a large industry, and some people estimate that there are currently more than a million fracking wells across the country.\nEnvironmental Concerns Related to Fracking\nAs with most types of energy drilling techniques, though, there are environmental concerns about fracking, and these concerns are increasing each year, due to more information coming to light about the effects fracking is having on local regions.\nThe most widespread concern people have with fracking techniques is that the groundwater used for residential drinking supplies will be contaminated due to leaking of the gas and chemicals used to extract it. In most wells, more than 99 percent of the fluids used are water and sand, some chemicals are added to aid in the flow of the natural gas. While the chemicals used can vary from well to well, the most commonly used chemicals include benzene, which is a known carcinogen. According to an article in Scientific American, the concern is not about a one-time fracturing operation, but multiple wells being built and operated multiple times in a geographic region. This more extensive fracking process increases the chances that groundwater will eventually become contaminated. Since no long-term studies have been conducted to evaluate fracking’s long-term effects, there is also concern that over time, due to the amount of fissures introduced into the shale, that gas and contaminants will enter groundwater.\nThere is also a concern that fracking processes also utilize what can be very precious water resources for their operations. It takes between 2 million and 3 million gallons of water per well to operate them. Multiply that figure by hundreds of wells, and there is a huge quantity of water required. In 2011, almost the entire state of Texas was experiencing drought conditions. One of the largest shale plays is located in Texas. It was understandable for citizens to be concerned that these wells were utilizing a resource that was much needed by its residents and other businesses. Some fracking operations, such as the Marcellus play, are creating processes to recycle their wells’ wastewater so that less water is consumed by each well.\nFracking Plays in the US\nHow Fracking Works\nBiggest Fracking Plays\nBiggest U.S. Fracking Plays\nShale Employment & Information Resources\nTop U.S. Shale Play Employers","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1793837"}

He’s also one of the most widely reprinted political commentators in the Louisiana blogosphere. From the Daily Kingfish to the Louisiana Conservative, from Bayou Buzz to various other outlets around the state, Jim Brown’s columns have received significant exposure throughout the interwebs of our region.\nHis site boasts that his “syndicated column appears each week in numerous newspapers and websites throughout the South.”\nUnfortunately for those outlets, Jim Brown has repeatedly lifted text from other sources and inserted it into his syndicated commentaries without citation. That’s plagiarism.\nI first got a whiff of it three years ago, when fellow blogger Greg Peters noted that one of Brown’s columns borrowed “great unattributed swaths” of text from another source. At the time, I discounted the error as an example of shoddy scholarship, or a lack of familiarity with the pull-quote method of Internet commentary, in which quoted text is clearly marked or set off in a different format. But Brown was on my radar after that. And, over the years, whenever I’d notice a change in narrative “voice,” I’d Google suspicious sentences from Brown’s commentaries and find that they echoed someone else’s work. These weren’t accidents or mere coincidences, either. Brown’s columns were always published subsequent to the strikingly similar texts. It was clear to me that Brown was repeatedly and intentionally borrowing directly from other sources.\nFrankly, I grew tired of seeing some of my favorite sites re-publish Brown’s lifted work. I pointed this out in the comments at these sites, linking to the the lifted work, but was told to post my grievances elsewhere.\nI can do that. And I’m not above admitting that this was motivated in part by good old-fashioned writer’s block. The words were not flowing at all, and then I recalled Brown’s tendency to lift text, and it inspired me to expose him.\nBelow is a sampling of texts that I believe were inappropriately lifted by Brown. By no means do I consider it an exhaustive list.\nIn his opinion column from Feb. 4, 2010 on the “Oregon approach,” you’ll see that Brown directly lifts from an op-ed by Dave Treibel at OregonLive.com published on Feb. 1, 2010. (Note that the last sentence in Treibel’s excerpt forms the crux of the first sentence in the Brown excerpt.)\nThe attitude seems to be that politics is permanently entrenched in the toxicity of divisive partisanship, but bright ideas always trump cynicism. The new sleek iPad tablet is loaded with impressive, sophisticated technology that Apple’s engineers have worked on for years. It’s the kind of “thinking ahead” philosophy and culture that Steve Jobs and Apple nurture and are known for. The Oregon approach seems to be what an interesting challenge it would be if they could corral an equivalent level of ingenuity and talent available to Steve Jobs to solve some of the complex issues facing their state.\nTreibel:\nThe new sleek tablet is loaded with impressive, sophisticated technology that Apple’s engineers have worked on for years. It’s the kind of “thinking ahead” philosophy and culture that Steve Jobs and Apple nurture and are known for. I thought, “Wouldn’t it be great if Obama could corral an equivalent level of ingenuity and talent available to Steve Jobs to solve some of the complex issues facing our country?”\nAmerican politics seem permanently entrenched in the toxicity of divisive partisanship, but bright ideas always trump cynicism.\nI sent these excerpts to The Oregonian for review. After inspecting both posts, an editor at The Oregonian said (my emphasis):\nMy own view in looking at the two pieces is that the Brown piece is a straight-out lift from a piece by Dave Treibel in “The Stump” by a blog on OregonLive.com. The Treibel piece is dated Feb. 1, 2010 and the Brown piece is dated several days later.\nI agree that it’s a “straight-out lift.” Unfortunately, it’s one of many.\nIn the same post, Brown lifts quite dated and inaccurate information from a Los Angeles Times article published back in 2008. Brown says:\nIn many cases, the train runs right up the middle of the street – stations are literally on the curb.\nPortland officials also drew a square around downtown and declared it a “fare less zone.” If you ride the train or the bus only within that zone, it’s free.\nAn identical passage from Steve Hymon’s LA Times articlefrom Aug. 18, 2008 reads:\nIn many cases, the trains run right up the middle of the street — stations are literally on the curb.\nPortland officials also drew a square around downtown and declared it a “fareless zone.” If you ride the train or the bus only within that zone, it’s free.\nI cataloged various other similarities in this Brown column to other sources here.\nAnother example comes from a Brown column from December 2010, where he wrote:\nFriedman’s ideas were embraced by President Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s, and lauded by many in the business world. But they were also controversial because of the deep cuts in government spending and the more restricted role they entailed for government in buffering citizens from economic forces.\nAside from an added comma, those sentences are taken vebatim from this CNNMoney.com obituary of Milton Friedman published in 2006.\nHere’s another example. Brown’s July 8, 2010 column reads:\nOn TV cameras in the court room, that are presently prohibited, Kagan is for them. Good for her on this issue. Her colleagues have for years thrown up the hoary arguments the television would undermine the high court’s “ethos” and bring forth the justices’ faces to C-Span-watching terrorists.\nAgain, he has swiped text and ideas from a Los Angeles Times editorial published a few days earlier on July 3, 2010:\nOne of the few subjects about which Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan was forthright at her confirmation hearings was cameras in the high court. She’s for ’em. Not for the hoary arguments that televising the court’s proceedings would undermine its “ethos” and introduce the justices’ faces to C-SPAN-watching terrorists.\nHere are some excerpts from Jim Brown’s column published on January 28, 2010:\nFor years, conservatives have argued that judicial restraint requires deferring to the choices of the elected branches of government. Statutes have been on the books since 1906 limiting corporate spending in federal election campaigns.\nThis same conservative court has for years limited free speech of government employees, students, and maintained a willingness to muzzle defendants through gag orders in criminal cases, but felt compelled to look out for corporate free speech. The message seems clear that conservative justices are happy to be activists when it serves their ideological agenda.\nNow look at this op-ed by UC Irvine professor Erwin Chemerinsky which appeared in the Los Angeles Times a week earlier. Note the similar passages as well as the sequence of ideas and argument:\nFor years, conservatives have argued that judicial restraint requires deferring to the choices of the elected branches of government. McCain-Feingold was a continuation of statutes that have existed since 1906 limiting corporate spending in federal election campaigns.\nThe conservative majority, which in recent years has dramatically limited free speech in other areas such as for government employees and for students was willing to expand the free speech of corporations. There is no way to see this other than as the conservative justices using judicial review to advance the traditional conservative ideological agenda.\nThe Los Angeles Times declined comment when I asked them about the similarities in these passages.\nThe sixth paragraph in this Jim Brown piece from August 19, 2010 reads:\nShortly after the Times story ran, conservative media personality Laura Ingraham interviewed Abdul Rauf’s wife, Daisy Khan, while guest-hosting “The O’Reilly Factor” on Fox. In hindsight, the segment is remarkable for its cordiality. “I can’t find many people who really have a problem with it,” Ingraham says of the mosque project, adding at the end of the interview, “I like what you’re trying to do.”\nNow compare this excerpt from a Salon article published on Aug. 16, 2010:\nConservative media personality Laura Ingraham interviews Abdul Rauf’s wife, Daisy Khan, while guest-hosting “The O’Reilly Factor” on Fox. In hindsight, the segment is remarkable for its cordiality. “I can’t find many people who really have a problem with it,” Ingraham says of the Cordoba project, adding at the end of the interview, “I like what you’re trying to do.”\nAgain, there’s not even a hint of citation for any of the above excerpts. Brown just brazenly passes them off as his own. This pattern is too pervasive and frequent to be excused as accidental or isolated “lapses.” Also, Brown has tweaked and modified the text enough to show that this is not merely a matter of sloppiness.\nThe above examples are only a sampling of instances where Brown has lifted text. I’d bet the farm there’s more.\nFrom what I’ve seen, when Brown lifts text, it’s usually only a few sentences, here and there. But it’s still wrong to do this without attribution, especially if you are being widely re-published. (In fact, if you’re using online search engines, the multitude of web sites that dutifully publish Brown’s columns serve to camouflage the original work.) He doesn’t do it in every paragraph, nor in every opinion piece. But he identifies himself as a writer, yet has repeatedly committed one of the biggest sins in writing.\nBrown’s Wikipedia page says that “Though his training is in law, his knowledge of Louisiana history and politics is seemingly unlimited. Brown sometimes teaches classes in Louisiana history, of which he is an undisputed authority…”\nHigh praise, indeed. And there seems to be some truth to that; most of the unattributed lifts occur when Brown is discussing national issues rather than Louisiana issues. Perhaps Brown is outside his comfort zone on these matters, or maybe he just gets lazy. Either way, it’s wrong to swipe ideas and words from other writers. That’s just common sense.\nGranted, these lifted quotes rarely form the heart of Brown’s commentaries. They’re just sprinkled around, here and there. They aren’t the worst cases of intellectual theft I’ve ever seen, but, then again, they don’t have to be. Any intentional misappropriation of text is too much. It’s unethical, and Brown knows better. After all, he is a writer, author, publisher, radio pundit, father of Campbell Brown, the a famous TV news reporter, and “Hall of Fame” caliber ex-politician. This is a man who continues to claim he was wrongfully convicted of making false statements to the FBI, yet he needlessly harms his remaining credibility by stealing other people’s work.\nBrown signs off on all his columns with the phrase “Peace and Justice.” Well, Brown does no justice to his sources when he uses their ideas and words without attribution. And if exposing this fact creates less peace for the numerous outlets which reprint his columns – so be it.\nMark Moseley blogs at Your Right Hand Thief.

He won me over with an e-mail which, in part, said this:\n“Sheeeeeesh! What’s going on at the P-T editorial room? You write a nifty, inoffensive piece on Al Gore’s new film and the anti-global warming dingbats explode with atomic force.”\nPowell was referring to Tim Ball, retired University of Winnipeg climatology professor, and Bob Carter, a professor at Australia’s James Cook University. Both wrote to the P-T last week, chastising me for suggesting that Gore’s film and book, “An Inconvenient Truth,” carries a message we should all consider.\nAsked reader Powell, “Isn’t the editorial board supposed to be on alert for that kind of thing and not let the P-T be used as part of a propaganda campaign?”\nIt’s a valid question. Hand in hand with industry polluters, Ball and Carter seem to be caught up in a movement to debunk Gore and global warming…\nLet’s start with the Australian global warming skeptic, Bob Carter. Melissa Fyfe, who writes for The Age, a Melbourne newspaper, notes that Carter is a member of the so-called Lavosier Group, a collection of global warming skeptics who are discredited by “the vast majority of scientists.”\nDebunking climate change, says Fyfe, “has also been taken up by right-wing think tanks, such as the Institute of Public Affairs,” which “receives funding from companies such as ExxonMobil.” Carter et al., she writes, constitute a “sophisticated machine that has successfully created the impression that climate change science is mired in uncertainty.”\nIn British Columbia, where skeptic Tim Ball lives in retirement, The Tee, an online publication, says “ExxonMobil has been astonishingly successful in delaying action on global warming for more than a decade.”\nTyee also says Ball “is in high demand by the front groups sponsored by the fossil fuel industry. Ball’s particular niche is the argument that since 1940, the world’s climate has actually been cooling.”\nThe online publication says Ball is promoted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, which has received funding from ExxonMobil, and Tech Central Station, which is supported, by, among others, General Motors…\nHennessy’s not-so-subtle message: Dr. Carter has been bought by industry, therefore, his views should be disregarded. Hennessy, however, shows no evidence linking Carter to industry, let alone that Carter’s views are for sale.\nHennessy’s attack on Dr. Tim Ball caught my eye because Hennessy dragged this institution, the National Center for Public Policy Research, into the fray.\nDr. Ball’s published letter to the Press-Telegram said, in part:\nI have seen the movie [An Inconvenient Truth] and, as someone with a doctorate in climatology, have studied the subject so long that when I began, the scientific consensus was that we were heading for another ice age. But Gore doesn’t understand that consensus is not a scientific fact. It is also clear he doesn’t understand how science works.\nThe global warming theory assumed carbon dioxide (CO2) traps heat in the atmosphere, and if it increases because of human additions to the total, then global temperature would rise. Unfortunately, environmentalists and people who saw human use of energy to develop technology and industry as wrong saw it as an opportunity to undermine Western development and civilization.\nThey politicized the issue and converted a scientific theory to a fact. Scientists like myself who tried to ask questions were called skeptics or more recently deniers with all the holocaust connotations.\nThe real inconvenient truth is that the fundamental assumption that CO2 causes warming has proven incorrect. Not only is the human portion not the cause, but CO2 itself is not the cause of global warming or climate change. Ice core records covering 420,000 years show temperature changing before CO2, not the other way around as implied by Gore.\nIn the 20th century most warming occurred before 1940, when production of CO2 was low. From 1940 to 1980, global temperatures went down while human addition of CO2 increased most dramatically. Since 1998 global temperatures have declined while human production of CO2 continues to increase.\nI would gladly sit down with Mr. Hennessy and go through Gore’s movie, scene by scene, and explain how it is distorted, taken out of context or otherwise manipulated.\nTim Ball\nOn July 7, I wrote to Tom Hennessy, for reasons the letter makes clear:\nDear Mr. Hennessey-\nVia Google, I happened upon your July 5 commentary, “Sense Wins in Heated Debate.”\nWith all due respect, isn’t it just a bit misleading to report that “[Dr. Tim] Ball is promoted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, which has received funding from ExxonMobil”? This makes it appear as though Dr. Ball received cash from us, and by extension ExxonMobil, when in fact all we did was reprint a small amount of his writing on one of our websites.\nBy that standard, every newspaper that publishes an op-ed by an outside pundit is a “promoter” of the pundit, and the pundit becomes associated with the beliefs and practices of the newspaper’s advertisers.\nGoogle also reveals that Dr. Ball has had his writing published in a number of newspapers. Are they “promoters” as well? I wouldn’t be surprised if some of those papers have from time-to-time run ads for the fossil fuel industry, or, perhaps, from automakers. Horrors.\nAs it happens, Dr. Ball has never received a penny from us, and our support from ExxonMobil amounts to less than one percent of our budget. This leaves Dr. Ball with zero percent of less than one percent. Not much! Yet, apparently, worthy of note in the press.\nEven though I’ve never met, talked to, or otherwise communicated with Dr. Ball, I know he has extensive scientific expertise. Possibly his ideas should be evaluated on their merits, instead of on the basis of his supposed association with us?\nAmy Ridenour\nThe National Center for Public Policy Research\nHennessy’s response:\nDear Ms. Ridenour\nThe next time you “happen upon” one of my columns, via Google, I hope you will read it more carefully than you did the last one. You wrote:\n“With all due respect, isn’t it just a bit misleading to report that ‘{Dr. Tim} Ball is promoted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, which has received funding from ExxonMobil.'”\nThat comment did not originate with me. It came from the Tyee, an online publication based in British Columbia. The sentence clearly attributed the thought to the online publication. I assume you have written to them as well.\nYou also said, “As it happens, Dr. Ball has never received penny from us…” I never said he did.\nSince you seem to present yourself as something of an expert on climate change, I assume you are well aware that Dr. Ball’s views are among a minority in the scientific community.\nAlthough we seem to be on opposite sides re this change, I appreciate your having written me to share your views.\nTom Hennessy, Columnist\nPress-Telegram, Long Beach, Ca\nI responded, somewhat less cordially:\nDear Mr. Hennessey,\nThank you for your reply. I appreciate it.\nI hope my reference to “happening” upon one of your columns was not taken as an insult, as none was intended. If I lived in your area of the country, I am sure I would be a subscriber and a regular reader.\nAs to the column we are discussing, I read it quite carefully, several times, and again after reading your recent correspondence. I am unable to draw any conclusion other than that you intended to undermine Dr. Ball’s credibility as an honest scientist after a letter by him disagreeing with you was published by your newspaper.\nYou refer to Dr. Ball and another scientist, Dr. Bob Carter, as acting “hand in hand with industry polluters” and say “some readers appear to have been taken in by them.”\nYou use juxtaposition to imply a connection between Dr. Ball and ExxonMobil: “In British Columbia, where skeptic Tim Ball lives in retirement, The Tyee, an online publication, says ‘ExxonMobil has been astonishingly successful in delaying action on global warming for more than a decade.'” Whether ExxonMobil has been successful in influencing public policy in British Columbia actually says nothing about Dr. Ball, but a casual reader will infer from your construction that the two are connected.\nYou further write: “Tyee also says Ball ‘is in high demand by the front groups sponsored by the fossil fuel industry…’“ In the Tyee, author Donald Gutstein identifies two organizations as having received “policy briefings” by Dr. Ball. These, presumably, are the “front groups.” The first is one of the most respected think-tanks in the world, the 32-year-old Fraser Institute, which receives one percent of its funding from ExxonMobil. It is best known internationally for its work on health care and economics. According to its website, Dr. Ball spoke there in 2005 and co-wrote a paper for them in 2004 on “limitations that hinder the usefulness of climate models.” The other “front group” is the Frontier Centre for Public Policy, which, according to its website, receives less than 20 percent of its income from all corporate sources combined, and which does not appear to consider energy policy/climate change among its top priorities. Based on a search of their website, its one connection to Dr. Ball is that he delivered a lecture there in 2004.\nThe best that can be said in your favor is that these facts paint a far more nuanced picture than what your readers learned from you after you chose to run an unchallenged quote that Ball “is in high demand by the front groups sponsored by the fossil fuel industry.”\nA more factual description more likely is that, over a two-year period, a retired academic spoke once time each to two of Canada’s most prestigious think-tanks, and co-wrote a paper for one of them. I can understand why this latter formulation would not strike a propagandist as a good way to undermine Dr. Ball’s professional credibility, but the fact that the Tyee’s formulation was stretched beyond reason should have been obvious to a professional journalist, if that professional journalist was doing any fact-checking whatsoever.\nThen your article asserts a connection between our group and Dr. Ball: “The online publication says Ball is promoted by the National Center for Public Policy Research, which has received funding from ExxonMobil…” I explained why this is simply silly in my earlier e-mail to you. In your reply, you essentially disavowed responsibility, blaming Donald Gutstein’s article in the Tyee for any errors, as that was your source.\nI am unwilling to let you off the hook so easily. Donald Gutstein and the Tyee misled its readers, but you misled yours. First, you used juxtaposition and implication to undermine a scientist’s reputation for honesty. Then you found and quoted another columnist who was doing the same thing — tarring a man’s reputation by misleading readers. You had the choice of checking the Tyee’s facts, and apparently did not take it (let us hope that you did not). Yet, it is your professional responsibility to check your facts. You write a professional column for a significant newspaper. When you write about serious issues, your readers expect more fact-checking than they would from a drunken sophomore posting his personal views for his frat buddies to read on MySpace. They didn’t get it. Depending on the sophomore, they may have gotten less.\nYou could have picked up the telephone. You could have done something even easier, and Googled the terms “Tim Ball” and the name of our group. The #1 entry when one does this is a May 3, 2006 blog post by me demonstrating the unreliability of Donald Gutstein’s Tyee article. Likewise, a joint search for “Tim Ball” and “Donald Gutstein” brings up the refutation of the Gutstein piece in #1 position. Even “Tim Ball” and “ExxonMobil” will do it, or “Tim Ball” and “coal.”\nI realize this e-mail may be considered harsh, but imagine how your column made your targets feel.\nColumnist Tom Hennessy did not respond to my second e-mail. I checked the Long Beach Press-Telegram later to see if a correction or clarification had been run to acknowledge that the Press-Telegram, through a staff column, had defamed two scientists, but I found no acknowledgement or apology.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1904875"}

Halloween Movies In Order\nMichael Myers simply will not die.\nBy Justin Kirkland\nImagine being a cool girl, just trying to live your life in Haddonfield, Illinois. It's fall, and my God, you love fall. You offer to do your dad (a realtor in town trying to sell a house) a favor by dropping off a key at one of his properties. Of course, it just so happens that at the same time, the boy who used to live there sees you, remembers everything about you, and then tries to kill you. This is why you should never do anyone any favors.\nThis is the start of the Halloween franchise, for you non-Michael Myers heads in the room. (Which is based on a true story, FYI.) Though, I suppose you should have been tipped off to the multi-film run by the headline of this article. You're here because you're searching out how to watch Halloween the right way, which is understandable. It's a stellar seasonal film that should be in the top 10 of any slasher movie fan. (It certainly is in ours.) But when you get into the details of the Halloween franchise, you'll quickly learn that there aren't just a couple of sequels. There are thirteen films in total. A full baker's dozen. And there are more planned! To what end, Michael Myers? TO WHAT END?\nSomething important to know: not all Halloween films are created equal, and thus, we take no responsibility for the time you will inevitably waste if you choose to watch Halloween: Resurrection. That's on you. But for the hell of it, let's explore all 13 and their respective timelines because, yes—you bet your ass there's multiple. (Need more gore? Check out the best zombie flicks ever next.)\nIt's the OG. The indisputable GOAT of the franchise. The film introduces us to Laurie, who seemingly gets mixed up with Michael Myers at random (more on that in a minute). He begins to stalk her, intent on killing her, but as the multiple movies suggest, Laurie doesn't go down without a fight. Of all the scream queens out there, Jamie Lee Curtis is the one to beat.\nPicking up almost directly where the first left off, Michael and Laurie square up again—this time, ending in an all out hospital brawl. And while neither of them make it out unscathed, the fate of a central figure comes to a close... for now.\nHalloween III: Season of the Witch\nFor purists, this film is garbage, largely because it doesn't even feature Michael Myers. For horror fans, it's become a cult favorite as the single standalone film in the franchise. There's witchcraft, Stonehenge, and commercials. Make of that what you will.\nLike, well, most fourth installments (except Land Before Time, which is a perfect franchise), Halloween 4 will leave you feeling deflated. As the title suggests, it does feature the return of Michael Myers, but it spends most of its time chasing the high of the first film with little to no effectiveness.\nHalloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers\nGood for Donald Pleasance for, presumably, working a multi-film deal into his contract.\nHalloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\nTo be frank, we're still on the downward slope here, but Donald Pleasance returns as Dr. Loomis, offering a bit of consistency. This one also features Paul Rudd playing Tommy, the boy Laurie Strode babysat in the first film.\nGreat news: the timeline starts over with Halloween H20, which is an objectively terrible name for a subjectively decent movie. Following the events of 1981's Halloween II, the film brings back Jamie Lee Curtis, alongside a list of upcoming actors from 1998. Michelle Williams! Josh Hartnett! Joseph Gordon Levitt! I mean, LL Cool J is here, too. This is a party.\nHalloween: Ressurection\nMichael Myers is beheaded (and survives). Laurie Strode is thrown off a building (and dies—after 24 years in the franchise??). Make it make sense!\nRob Zombie really said, \"I'm going to take this concept and just create my own universe.\" Classic Rob. A bit of a reimagining based on the original, Halloween manages to give Michael Myers a bit more backstory (and falls heavily on Laurie Strode being Michael's sister), but truly had no chance of unseating the original.\nFor some reason, Octavia Spencer and Weird Al Yankovich are in this sequel. That's all I can remember because the rest of my mind is absolutely drenched in all the blood and gore that outweighs the rest of the movie.\nIn the 2018 reboot, Myers and Strode face off one more time. Reworking the timeline, this Halloween only incorporates the first film into its timeline. All these years later, Laurie is still vexed by Michael knowing he's out there, though her family thinks she's nuts. That's fine... until he actually does show up again.\nFollowing up on the massively successful reboot from 2018, Halloween Kills surpassed expectations and made over $131 million at the box office. Though it appeared that Myers was quite literally toasted in that house fire, he is back and Laurie Strode has someone on her side that she's never had before: Judy Greer.\nWill Halloween truly end in the upcoming finale to David Gordon Green's latest Michael Myers trilogy? We doubt it! But that hasn't stopped Jamie Lee Curtis from touting her last appearance in the horror series as the \"final reckoning.\"\nJustin Kirkland Writer Justin Kirkland is a Brooklyn-based writer who covers culture, food, and the South.\n19 Facts You Didn’t Know About Deadpool\nWhen Will James Cameron Let Us Stream Avatar?\nWe Need an Academy Award For Best Animal Actor\nYour Lord and Savior 'M3GAN' Is Streaming\nThe Most Anticipated Documentaries of 2023\nSteven Spielberg Says 'The Dark Knight' Was Robbed\nCheck Out These Vintage Awards Show Photos\n'Dungeons & Dragons' Looks Deliciously Batshit\nPaul Mescal's Family Is Hyped About His Oscar Nom\nThere's One Way You Can Right Tom Cruise's Snub","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line909991"}

David Hedley, Advancement\nDeep beneath the Earth’s surface lies an almost endless supply of energy. Gordon Brasnett remembers even as a child being intrigued by the possibilities. “Family camping trips where we visited hot springs in Alberta and B.C. probably reinforced this interest,” he says.\nToday, as the world looks for ways to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, geothermal energy holds great promise as an alternative, especially in western Canada. But tapping the resource won’t be easy or cheap. Brasnett, a geophysicist who graduates this fall with a Master of Science in Sustainable Energy Development (SEDV) from the School of Public Policy at the University of Calgary, tackled a big question: Where in Alberta are the most economically viable locations to build new geothermal projects?\nHis answer, created as a capstone research project toward his degree, includes a publicly available, interactive model that considers the economic viability of particular areas across Alberta for future geothermal development. His visualizations draw on a matrix of data sources, such as pioneering research by University of Alberta scientist Dr. Jacek Majorowicz, who estimated the drilling depths required to reach progressively hotter geothermal sources.\nMapping the potential for future projects\nBrasnett’s interactive model looks at all of Alberta, illustrating the geothermal depths yielding temperatures between 40°C and 80°C — for direct-heating uses such as warming buildings or greenhouses — and temperatures between 120°C and 150°C — hot enough to generate electricity as well as ambient heat.\nHe continues: “The regions with the highest gradients and therefore the shallowest estimated depths to 120°C are found west of Zama City, east of Rainbow Lake, and north of Rimbey. The estimated depths to reach 120°C in these areas are in the range of 2,250 to 2,800 metres.”\nFinding an optimal geothermal location means balancing other factors too, such as: distance to where heat energy can be used, up-front costs of drilling and construction, and opportunities to generate future revenue. “My model showed that the regions with the highest gradients may not necessarily be the cheapest areas to develop for a project, as they may be too far from existing roads, transmission lines, and customers to use heat. As a result, the model showed that areas closer to Grande Prairie, Fox Creek, and Lacombe may be developed more economically for a 120°C project.”\nBrasnett hopes his map helps spark conversations and inspire site-specific feasibility studies by remote municipalities and other early geothermal adopters. “In my opinion, the early adopters of geothermal projects will be people who need large quantities of heat, but who don’t want the greenhouse gas emissions or price uncertainty associated with burning hydrocarbons.\n“This could be people developing district heating systems for warehouses, industrial parks, office parks, campus spaces, greenhouses, or residential buildings.”\nMap shows the rate at which subsurface temperatures change as a function of depth. Yellow, orange and red regions get hotter faster, with subsurface temperatures in the range of 35-50°C at a depth of 1000m, compared to the green and blue regions.\nCapstone project by Gordon Brasnett. Click on the map to see the online interactive model.\nNew engine for economic growth\nAlberta has a successful history of applying innovation and technology to resources such as agriculture and the oilsands. Brasnett believes geothermal energy can grow into a new economic engine.\nHis interest in the field led him to study in UCalgary’s multidiscipinary SEDV program, offered through the School of Public Policy, Haskayne School of Business, Schulich School of Engineering, School of Architecture, Planning, and Landscape, and Faculty of Law. In the 16-month professional master’s program, SEDV students learn about energy systems, both current and future, through the lenses of technology, policy, business, and social impact. Students in the program build skills in collaboration, teamwork, communication, and research, enabling them to advance their careers across the energy sector. The emphasis is on developing energy projects that maximize social and economic benefits, and minimize negative environmental impacts.\nStudents like Brasnett are watching closely as the first large-scale geothermal projects take shape. For example, the Alberta No. 1 Geothermal Energy Project, a partnership developed by Terrapin Geothermics near Grande Prairie, will contribute clean geothermal energy to the grid while supplying heat for local industry. The Indigenous-led Tu-Deh-Kah partnership near Fort Nelson, B.C., is developing geothermal heat from a depleted natural gas field to support electricity, agriculture, and other local initiatives. The Latitude 53 project by Novus Earth Energy near Hinton focuses on renewable energy and food security. Calgary-based Eavor Technologies is testing its ultra-deep, closed-loop geothermal drilling system near Rocky Mountain House.\nOpening new doors\nThe SEDV program opened new doors for Brasnett. The research capstone project is a core part of the curriculum, where students apply concepts learned in the program to a real-world question, in partnership with industry, NGOs, government, and academic partners. His research project was supported by the Mitacs Business Strategy Internship program. His supervising professor was Dr. Roman Shor, director of the Energi Simulation Centre for Geothermal Systems Research at UCalgary. For the project they collaborated with Dr. Catherine Hickson, CEO of the Alberta No. 1 Geothermal Energy Project.\n“There are a lot of interesting pilot projects around the world today that may kick off a flurry of development throughout the 2020s in countries where geothermal is still a new technology,” Brasnett says. “I’m optimistic that Alberta can be a leader in this space given the geoscience, engineering, drilling skills, and technologies that the oil and gas sector has developed over the past 60-plus years.”\nThinking about your next career move?

(Photo by Chris Granger | The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate)\nSTAFF PHOTO BY CHRIS GRANGER\nCharity, who already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud in a plea deal with prosecutors, was the latest in a series of prosecution witnesses during the first two weeks of Ryan’s federal trial related to the $1,000 bank collapse. millions.\nMost of the witnesses so far have testified on variations on the same theme: that Ryan, despite knowing that the borrowers would not be able to repay their loans, allegedly kept that from his board.\nRyan’s lawyers have tried to deny the claims, saying he was personally dealing with some of the bank’s most troublesome customers and trying to keep them afloat.\nTestimony and cross-examination on Friday followed the same pattern.\nA benefactor relationship\nCharity described how he had entered into a business relationship with Ryan when First NBC was founded in 2006. He said that in the early years of their relationship, First NBC loaned him hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy houses for post-Hurricane Katrina renovations, he and Ryan developed a personal bond.\n“I got to know Ryan very well and we were friends,” said Charity, noting that Ryan was the godfather of two of her children and had vouched for him at expensive local private schools. “I trusted him unconditionally. He had a solid reputation, he was highly respected.”\nCharity said Ryan eventually helped him get involved in bigger projects, including a $1 million condo and beignet deal in the Jax Brewery building on Decatur Street in the French Quarter.\nHe also bought three gas stations on the North Shore and a defunct shopping center on Robert E. Lee Boulevard (now Allen Toussaint Boulevard), which had been badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina.\n‘Lies like a rug’\nBut the government argued that Ryan realized as early as 2011 that Charity was a poor businessman who consistently failed to hold meetings, file documents, pay business taxes owed to the city, file permit applications and handle other routine business tasks. . .\nBrian DeJean, a former Charity accountant, testified that he had dropped him as a client in 2012 because he consistently failed to provide basic documents and was lying about it.\n“He wasn’t trustworthy,” DeJean said. “He lied and lied again. He lied like a rug.”\nDeJean said that Ryan had been told in a meeting of Charity’s chronic shortcomings, but agreed that Ryan seemed to be doing everything he could to help Charity.\nIn testimony earlier this week, two program directors who oversee grants to renovate New Orleans buildings after Katrina, Adrienne Celestine and Aimee Quirk, testified that the Charity had been turned down for grants because it had failed to provide the documents that were requested. they had repeatedly requested.\nProsecutors said Ryan had told banking supervisory boards that the grant money was on the way when he knew it had been turned down. His defense attorney responded that Ryan had helped Charity reapply for the grants and hoped they would still be able to get the funds.\nFormer First NBC executive Ashton Ryan, Jr., right, walks with his wife Jolene to the US District Court in New Orleans for his trial on Tuesday, January 10, 2023. (Photo by Chris Granger | The Times-Picayune | The New Orleans Advocate )\nDespite his mounting debts, the government argued that Ryan continued to lend more and more to Charity and claimed in bank documents that Charity was using the money to develop property, when in fact it was using the loan proceeds to pay off older loans and to cover personal expenses. .\nIn one case, they pointed to a series of three $500,000 loans made to Charity in the spring of 2015, ostensibly to renovate the forecourt of Beignet’s Decatur Street store, but used largely to pay interest on outstanding loans and to personal expenses.\nCharity agreed with prosecutors that Ryan had known he was essentially broke since at least early 2015 and was using the money to give the appearance that the loans were current.\nDuring cross-examination, Ryan’s defense attorney, Edward Castaing Jr., tried to show that Charity was lying about Ryan’s extent of knowledge in order to get a lighter sentence. He also painted Ryan as someone Charity regularly lied to.\nnot a sister\nHe questioned Charity about her relationship with Stephanie Carter-Stinson, a Washington, DC-based physician who had been a guarantor for all of Charity’s loans.\nCharity, 58, married with five children, agreed that she had represented Carter-Stinson to Ryan and other bank officials as her sister, when in fact she was someone with whom he was romantically involved.\nCastaing pointed out, and Charity agreed, that Carter-Stinson had an income of more than $500,000 a year, net assets of more than $5 million, and was the main reason the loans kept flowing. The loans were also backed by property liens.\nCastaing also pointed out that Charity blamed his wife for out-of-control personal spending when she agreed to cooperate, saying she had a bipolar condition and couldn’t help but spend money.\nCastaing then listed the purchases Charity had made for himself, including gold and diamond necklaces and cufflinks, a dozen Rolex watches, as well as other high-end watches like a Breitling Bentley and a TAG Heuer, which together would cost more than $ 100,000. .\nThe evidence showed that the relationship between Ryan and Charity soured over time. An email exchange in November 2016 showed Ryan rejecting Charity’s efforts to get another loan to buy a new SUV.\n“You’re an asshole,” Ryan wrote to Charity, noting that he already owned two five-year-old Mercedes-Benz cars and needed to prioritize paying off the loans.\nCharity agreed to plead guilty in July 2019 in the hope of a reduced sentence in exchange for her testimony. Ryan’s trial, which began on January 9, is expected to last four to six weeks.\nIndia’s Adani Group plans to spin off more businesses; dismiss worries about debt\nNasdaq rises 2.7% as tech leads Friday’s stock rally","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line760770"}

On the surface, the bill is an advance on what came before. As of March 23rd 2010, an extra 32 million US citizens now have health insurance, insurance can no longer be refused based on medical histories, and there is a sizeable increase of Medicare coverage for people on low incomes.\nBut most healthcare campaigners are highly critical about the new bill and the way it was arrived at. The bill will still leave 23 million Americans uninsured. The new law will force middle income earners to buy insurance, costing as much as 9.5 per cent of their income, which would still only cover about 70% of medical expenses. To cap it all off, the already incredibly powerful insurance companies will be given an extra $450 million a year in public money to subsidise their insurance packages, handing over more money to the private sector.\nIn short, this Act does nothing to really challenge the profit-driven stranglehold of the insurance companies over healthcare in the US. Many Americans will not see any benefit until 2014 when all the measures of the bill finally come into force, and by then the insurance companies could have increased their premiums substantially. Physicians for a National Health Program likened the new bill to “using an aspirin to treat cancer.”\nRight up to the last minute, concession after concession was made to the Republican (and Democrat) opponents of universal healthcare entitlement. Under the new law, thanks to Democrat Senator Bart Stupak, an agent of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, women will have to pay for insurance cover on abortions “100% out of their own pocket”. “Pro-choice” activists expressed concern that, if insurance for abortions has to be paid separately to the health care companies, some might drop it as an option.\nA further problem in the provision of healthcare for women is that, although the bill bans using gender as a factor when costing premiums (currently many women have to pay more for the same insurance package as a man, and workplaces with a majority female workforce have to pay more insurance) these provisions will not come fully into force until 2017. No wonder the National Organisation of Women referred to the bill as a “a giant leap backward for women”.\nMany of his supporters are enraged that Obama caved in on so many key points of the Act as it made its way through the congress. The problem stems from two points, the first is that the Democrat party, wedded to capitalism and heavily funded by the health insurance companies, did not want too radical a reform bill. The second point, related to the first, is that Obama refused to use his campaigning base to establish more support for a radical version of the bill. The right mobilised significant pressure from its base, with demonstrations and protests across the country, designed to put pressure on wavering politicians to oppose the legislation, or fight for it to be further watered down. The right wing populist Tea Party movement, organised a protest on Capitol Hill the day before the act was passed where Democrat politicians were harassed, some were called “niggers” and “faggots” and even subjected to physical abuse, reported the Huffington Post.\nThe language from the Republican politicians themselves was designed to provoke emotional and irrational anger, “a little bit of freedom dies here today” declared Marsha Blackburn. “Will we choose the path of individual liberty or will we choose the path of government tyranny” asked Ted Poe, using the popular buzzwords from the Tea Party campaigners demanding that the tree of liberty be watered with the blood of tyrants. And when John Shadegg said that the bill was destroying freedom in the US, he was clearly referring to the total freedom of the insurance companies to make money from people’s illnesses.\nFor their part, Obama and the Democrats purposefully kept a lid on the activist base, clearly concerned that, if they mobilised such forces, the expectations of the movement would far outstrip anything that the Democrats were willing to offer in congress. This is because the Democrats cannot actually provide what so many people want and need, fully funded, free healthcare available at the point of demand.\nThe choice was over a continuation of the appalling free market system, which has ruled health care for generations, or some modest government intervention which would help paper over the cracks of healthcare provision in the US, whilst maintaining the profit system for the insurance companies. When stripped down to its bare essentials, this is a reform package which does not slay the beast of market profits in healthcare, but tries to tame it.\nNow the battle is on to destroy even what has been achieved so far. The Republicans will be running in the mid term elections in the Autumn under a “repeal the Bill” ticket, no doubt accusing the Obama administration of “socialism” and “government take over of healthcare”. The Democrats are promising to defeat the Republicans but they have a track record of caving in under pressure and conceding strategic ground to the populist right on such issues. Of course, many Democrats themselves (the so called blue-dog Democrats) opposed the bill and act as a fifth column within their own party ranks on the health care issue. Currently, the Republicans stand united on their hatred of the healthcare reforms.\nThis highlights the problem of the reformist logic. Making concessions to the Republicans did not lead to any increase in bipartisan support, instead it resulted in a watered down bill and an entrenched opposition. The “public option” government health insurance provision as an alternative to the private pension schemes was unceremoniously dropped. If this is the best reform that can be brought about through the mechanisms of the US government, then it is clear that a more radical route is needed – “Power to the (Working) People!” Working people in the US, who most desperately needed, and still need, a genuine free health care system, should bear in mind Lenin's words “reforms are the by-product of the revolutionary struggle”, and that is what is lacking in the US today.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1073196"}

In fact, its headquarters, a small strip mall on a busy road in San Diego’s Mission Valley, is little more than a year old. But its founder and manager, Jennifer Bancroft, says the name itself has become something of a joke. “They’ve been calling me House of the Dragon, and they were saying it’s a new kind of Dragon,” she says. “I don’t know what Dragon means.”\nEveryday Low’s hair-care products were first introduced in 2012. They have since seen a steady rise in demand; the company has expanded to 15 international locations, and has even opened one in London. It’s become a cult-favorite online brand, with a social-media following of over 100,000 people. But its products may never have made it out of the San Diego market, according to Bancroft. “We’re very small,” she says. “When we first started we were very lean.”\nBancroft came up with the brand name and the marketing strategy for Everyday Low in about 2011. She wanted to sell a product that was more than just moisturizing hair. She looked to make a bigger statement. “I came up with this idea of ‘House of the Dragon’ for an Asian dragon in the Asian culture,” Bancroft says. “It was like, look what we’re doing here.”\nThe term House of the Dragon was originally coined, she says, “by a friend of mine, who is Korean, called ‘dongi,’\nCategories latest Tags celebrity, chemistry, clinical trials, coronavirus, nobel prizes\nKamala Harris is the only candidate running for the Democratic Party\nPaul Pogba says he would have preferred to play for City\nThe City of Baltimore has approved only 9% of the low-cost housing projects it says it was supposed to approve\nTwitter’s CEO, Jack Dorsey, made the changes on the day after Twitter disclosed quarterly earnings.\nThe Persuaders: A New Generation of Politicians\nSerena Williams loses to world number six Vesnina in US Open quarterfinals\nThe Journey to San Francisco State\nZEBRAS CULLED in Kenya’s Famine\nPublic Health Nutrition: The New Normality of Life Without Public Health","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1731534"}

Usher’s considerable achievements begin with over 45 million records sold world wide and a stable of five Grammy awards. The singer, composer, producer, actor, businessman, designer and philanthropist is the quintessential contemporary icon, celebrated for nearly two decades.\nCountry: Taipei\nUsher, a self-described “master of the moment,” was born to lead-from the stage to the boardroom. Over the course of his exemplary career, Usher has led by countless examples, creating a rich catalog of hit songs and crowning achievements. With the release of his monumental seventh album, Raymond v Raymond, Usher returns to his original medium – making songs into masterpieces that illuminate the struggle between man and legend.\nThe DVD was declared seven times platinum. He won over fans and critics alike with accolades, which continue to multiply: 5 Grammy Awards, 4 American Music Awards, 8 Soul Train Music Awards, 4 BET Awards, 3 Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award, 6 Teen Choice Awards, a Blockbuster Music Award, 3 R&B Hip Hop Conference Awards, 9 ASCAP Awards, a staggering 17 Billboard Music Awards and countless other international awards from several countries.\nUsher may indeed have super hero DNA, which is one plausible explanation for how one man is able to accomplish so much. Usher, a seasoned television and film actor, hit the Broadway stage in 2006 playing the riveting lead, Billy Flynn in Chicago to a sold-out audiences as the youngest cast member in the lead role of the slick-talking lawyer persona. “They say to be an entertainer, you have to do it all,” says Usher. “When I was young and decided I wanted to be in entertainment, I watched people like Bob Fosse, Sammy Davis Jr. and Ben Vereen. They were triple threats – dancing, acting, and singing. It really inspired me. I want to live up to that title and showcase all of my talents and be able to say I’ve experienced it all, and had fun in the process.”\nwww.ushernow.com\nwww.twitter.com/UsherRaymondIV\nwww.myspace.com/usher\nwww.facebook.com/usher\nShared this page:\nPitbull Live in Jakarta 2011\nUsher Live in Kuala Lumpur 2010","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1513778"}

Norfolk Southern Railway Co.\nCountering the Plaintiffs' Bar | Personal Jurisdiction / Standing to Sue\n“The Supreme Court long ago abandoned Pennsylvania Fire’s reasoning. It is time for the Court to officially overrule that mistaken precedent.”\n—John Masslon, WLF Senior Litigation Counsel\nClick here for WLF’s brief.\nWASHINGTON, DC— Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) today filed an amicus curiae brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold constitutional limits on Pennsylvania state courts’ exercise of general personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. In a brief filed in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., WLF argued that Pennsylvania’s long-arm statute, which provides that any out-of-state corporation registering to do business in Pennsylvania may be sued there for any dispute arising from anywhere, violates the Due Process Clause.\nThe case arises from Mallory’s alleged exposure to toxic chemicals while he worked for Norfolk Southern in Ohio and Virginia. Even though the company was headquartered in and incorporated in Virginia at the time of suit, Mallory was a resident of Virginia, and the exposure occurred outside Pennsylvania, Mallory sued in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The Pennsylvania courts held that the Commonwealth’s long-arm statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Georgia Supreme Court, relying on Pennsylvania Fire v. Gold Issue, however, reached the opposite conclusion for a similar Georgia statute and the Supreme Court agreed to resolve the split in authority.\nIn its brief supporting Norfolk Southern, WLF examines the stare decisis factors and explains why the Court should overrule its 1917 Pennsylvania Fire decision. That decision is unworkable in the e-commerce era, was poorly reasoned, and there are no reliance interests that warrant keeping the decision. Most importantly, however, Pennsylvania Fire cannot be reconciled with the Court’s more recent personal-jurisdiction decisions. Thus, the time has come for the Court to explicitly overrule Pennsylvania Fire. WLF’s brief also explains why the Court should not address Mallory’s historical arguments that he raised for the first at the Supreme Court. The case is set for oral argument on November 8.\nCelebrating its 45th year, WLF is America’s premier public-interest law firm and policy center advocating for free-market principles, limited government, individual liberty, and the rule of law.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1301128"}

Reports Second Quarter 2021 Results\nQuest Delivered 51.4% Year-over-Year Revenue Growth\nIHT Revenue Increased by 46% Year-over-Year\nTeam, Inc.\nSUGAR LAND, Texas, Aug. 3, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Team, Inc. (NYSE: TISI), a global leading provider of integrated, digitally-enabled asset performance assurance and optimization solutions, today reported its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021.\nSecond Quarter 2021 Results:\nRevenue of $238.9 million, up $49.6 million, or 26.2%, from Q2 2020\nIHT and Quest segment revenue increased by 46.0% and 51.4%, respectively from Q2 2020\nGross margin was $62.8 million, up $5.4 million from Q2 2020\nQuest adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.6%, surpassing the 2020 full year average of 24.1%\n\"TEAM's second quarter results reflect a mix of activity recovery and challenging market dynamics,\" said Amerino Gatti, TEAM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Although we are not pleased with our overall results, revenue was at the upper end of our outlook. All three segments achieved revenue growth over Q2 2020 with Quest reporting the largest overall percent increase at 51%. Inspection & Heat Treating followed at approximately 46% and Mechanical Services at 4.7%. The year-over-year topline growth was driven by strong April activity levels from several large turnaround projects. May and June activity benefited from increased economic activity as COVID-related restrictions began to lift. While COVID continued to force project delays, especially internationally, activity levels throughout the quarter were mostly in line with expectations, highlighting improved economic growth across the various end markets in which we serve.\n\"TEAM faced margin headwinds in the second quarter. We experienced inflation in several areas, such as raw materials, transportation, and labor as well as increased technician training, and lingering COVID-related pricing concessions. We remain focused on cost discipline and continue to look for ways to mitigate overall inflationary pressures. Pricing negotiations have started with our clients to reflect current market conditions. Given these proactive actions, combined with the transitory nature of the cost increases, we expect our gross margin to improve in the second half of the year.\n\"We continued our long-standing culture of technology innovation. After several successful field tests, the Mechanical Services segment commercialized our new, patent pending SmartStopTM Isolation Technology. This new double block and bleed isolation system increases integrity and overall safety, further strengthening our competitive advantages in the hot tapping market. Additionally, we entered into an agreement to become the exclusive provider of Credosoft Integrity Management Software in North America. The software enhances TEAM's ability to monitor assets, ensure compliance and provide inspection and repair solutions. The Credosoft service offering provides TEAM a stable, subscription-based revenue profile and further positions the company to be a leading provider of integrated digitally-enabled asset performance optimization solutions.\n\"As we enter the second half of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about increased activity levels associated with an improving economy. While the recent emergence of COVID variants is concerning and could negatively impact our activity levels, the outlook for the fall turnaround season looks solid since operators are now in a better financial position to start previously postponed maintenance projects. Additionally, our international operations should benefit from progress of the vaccine rollout and the gradual removal of lockdown restrictions in key markets. Therefore, we expect sequential revenue growth to continue in the third quarter.\n\"We are making advances towards further revenue diversification into new markets, such as renewable energy and expanding regulatory services that include emissions control. Our revenue diversification efforts as well as investments in technology and digital are poised to be future growth drivers. TEAM is well-positioned to benefit from a strong economic recovery by capitalizing on built-up demand and pursuing opportunities that utilize the depth and breadth of our portfolio. We have a clear strategic plan to become more capital efficient, capture profitable growth, and generate positive cash flow,\" concluded Mr. Gatti.\nConsolidated net loss in the second quarter of 2021 was $17.5 million ($0.57 loss per diluted share) compared to a loss of $13.5 million ($0.44 loss per diluted share) in the second quarter of 2020. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was $9.1 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $12.7 million for the prior year quarter.\nConsolidated revenue for the second quarter of 2021 was $238.9 million compared to $189.3 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue increased due to higher activity levels from increased economic activity in the U.S. and select international markets as economies opened from COVID-related shutdowns. In the second quarter of 2021, consolidated gross margin was $62.8 million, or 26.3%, compared with 30.3% in the same quarter a year ago. Gross margin was negatively impacted by cost inflation pressure combined with lingering COVID-related price discounts and the reinstatement of temporary cost reductions that TEAM enacted in 2020.\nSG&A for the second quarter was $68.5 million, up $9.6 million, or a 16.3% increase from the second quarter of 2020. The company's adjusted measure of net income/loss, Consolidated Adjusted EBIT, a non-GAAP measure was a loss of $3.4 million in the second quarter compared to a loss of $0.2 million in the prior year comparable quarter.\nSecond quarter 2021 reported results include certain net charges not indicative of TEAM's core operating activities, including: $0.7 million of professional costs related to the previously announced new strategic organizational structure (\"Operating Group Reorganization\"), $0.3 million of severance charges primarily associated with the Operating Group Reorganization, and $1.6 million for accrued legal matters and other legal fees. Net of tax, these items totaled $2.6 million or $0.08 per diluted share.\nAdjusted net loss, consolidated Adjusted EBIT, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items that are not indicative of TEAM's core operating activities. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is at the end of this release.\nSegment Results\nThe following table illustrates the composition of the company's revenue and operating income (loss) by segment for the quarters ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nJune 30,\nIncrease (Decrease)\nRevenues by business segment:\nQuest Integrity\nCorporate and shared support services\nAll three business segments delivered year-over-year revenue growth due to higher activity levels from increased economic activity in the U.S. and select international markets as economies opened up from COVID-related shutdowns. IHT results included a 46.0% year-over-year improvement in revenue primarily due to increased activity levels in the U.S. and Canada and 56.0% increase in operating income. MS delivered a 4.7% year-over-year improvement in revenue due to an increase in Turnaround projects and call-out work. However, MS's operating income declined due to inflationary cost pressures in raw materials and labor. Quest Integrity's results included a 51.4% year-over-year improvement in revenue and a $5.0 million increase in operating income. The increase in Quest Integrity is primarily the result of easing COVID-related global restrictions, additional subsea inspection work, and increased demand for Quest's proprietary services.\nCash and Debt\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents were $18.4 million at June 30, 2021.

Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, operating income for IHT would be $4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2020.\nThe Company uses supplemental non-GAAP financial measures which are derived from the consolidated financial information including adjusted net income (loss); adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, earnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\"); adjusted EBIT (defined below); adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"adjusted EBITDA\") and free cash flow to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\nThe Company defines adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share and adjusted EBIT to exclude the following items: costs associated with our OneTEAM program, costs associated with the Operating Group Reorganization, non-routine legal costs and settlements, restructuring charges, certain severance charges, goodwill impairment charges, loss on debt extinguishment and certain other items that we believe are not indicative of core operating activities. Consolidated adjusted EBIT, as defined by us, excludes the costs excluded from adjusted net income (loss) as well as income tax expense (benefit), interest charges, foreign currency (gain) loss, and items of other (income) expense. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA further excludes from consolidated adjusted EBIT depreciation, amortization and non-cash share-based compensation costs. Segment adjusted EBIT is equal to segment operating income (loss) excluding costs associated with our OneTEAM program, costs associated with the Operating Group Reorganization, non-routine legal costs and settlements, restructuring charges, certain severance charges, goodwill impairment charges and certain other items as determined by management. Segment adjusted EBITDA further excludes from segment adjusted EBIT depreciation, amortization, and non-cash share-based compensation costs. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities minus capital expenditures. Net debt is defined as the sum of the current and long-term portions of debt, including finance lease obligations, less cash and cash equivalents.\nManagement believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of our financial position and results of operations. In particular, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted share, consolidated adjusted EBIT, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA are meaningful measures of performance which are commonly used by industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies to analyze operating performance in our industry, perform analytical comparisons, benchmark performance between periods, and measure our performance against externally communicated targets. Our segment adjusted EBIT and segment adjusted EBITDA is also used as a basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments. Free cash flow is used by our management and investors to analyze our ability to service and repay debt and return value directly to stakeholders.\nNon-GAAP measures have important limitations as analytical tools, because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net earnings and operating income. These measures should not be considered substitutes for their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Further, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies who may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. The liquidity measure of free cash flow does not represent a precise calculation of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are presented below.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(unaudited, in thousands except per share data)\nAdjusted Net Income (Loss):\nProfessional fees and other1\nLegal costs2\nSeverance charges, net3\nTax impact of adjustments and other net tax items4\nAdjusted net loss\nAdjusted net loss per common share:\nConsolidated Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA:\nForeign currency loss (gain)6\nPension expense (credit)5\nConsolidated Adjusted EBIT\nAmount included in operating expenses\nAmount included in SG&A expenses\nTotal depreciation and amortization\nNon-cash share-based compensation costs\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nFree Cash Flow:\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2021, includes $0.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of costs associated with the Operating Group Reorganization (exclusive of restructuring costs).

Today, August 24, 2017, she has been discharged from the Uganda Heart Institute after her successful surgery on Wednesday, August 16, 2017. The surgeons have assured us that Patricia is in a stable condition and she will gradually heal from the post-surgery pain. Patricia has started standing and walking on her own, and she can smile and laugh.\nPatricia was born with holes in her heart, which prevented her from growing and developing normally. Her mother is a housewife and her father is a primary school teacher. Before receiving help from Real Medicine Foundation, they sold everything they had, including a piece of land, to preserve Patricia’s life, but even that was not enough to pay for services at the Uganda Heart Institute. When RMF learned about Patricia’s situation in 2016, we agreed to cover expenses for her treatment at the Uganda Heart Institute. With treatment, Patricia has gradually improved, and thanks to RMF’s support, she underwent heart surgery on August 16, 2017 as a durable solution to her illness.\nPatricia’s parents are thankful to RMF beyond what words can express, and RMF is grateful to the Uganda Heart Institute for every special consideration they offered to our young patient. We also thank our donors, whose support made Patricia’s treatment and surgery possible.\nPatricia is now 3 years and 4 months old, and after recovering from the surgery, she will join school. It is our goal to support Patricia’s education so that she is empowered to contribute to the wellbeing of others when she grows up. Please contact RMF to donate towards Patricia’s education and medical check-ups, which still require funding. Patricia’s next check-up will be on September 21, 2017.

Through the first six days of early voting, about 10,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary elections than in the Republican primaries in the state’s 15 largest counties.William Luther /San Antonio Express-News\nAUSTIN — Strong early voting numbers by Democrats are beginning to worry some of Texas’ biggest Republican names.\nGov. Greg Abbott’s campaign sent out an email blast to supporters Monday warning that Democrats are surging and becoming a real concern headed into the midterm election cycle.\n“If these trends continue, we could be in real trouble come Election Day,” the email says.\nThrough the first six days of early voting, about 10,000 more people voted in the Democratic primary elections than in the Republican primaries in the state’s 15 largest counties. Four years ago — the most recent year with a gubernatorial election — Republicans were 54,000 voters ahead of Democrats.\nIn Bexar County, 16,463 voters cast a ballot in the Democratic primary through the first six days; 12,654 voted in the Republican primary.\nOverall, 186,000 Democrats have voted through the first week of early voting, well ahead of the 101,000 who voted at the same point in 2014.\nFor Democrats, the numbers are more evidence that their voters are energized going into the midterm elections. Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa has pointed to frustration with President Donald Trump as a major reason for the Democratic surge this year in early voting.\n“Your vote is your voice; the best way to stop Donald Trump, protect our communities, and promote our progressive economic values is to vote in the Democratic Primary,” Hinojosa said about the early turnout numbers.\nIt also comes at a time that Democrats have been winning special elections in places Trump won in 2016.\n“Democrats are already on a winning streak, flipping seats in special elections across the country in GOP strongholds,” the Abbott campaign email warns. “We’ve seen a surge of liberal enthusiasm in deep red states like Georgia, Alabama and Oklahoma. We had always hoped the liberal wave would never hit Texas, but these Early Voting returns aren’t encouraging so far.”\nThe letter calls on supporters to vote in the primaries and to make donations to help fund get-out-the-vote efforts.\nDemocrats have been boosted this year by a combination of factors. Opposition to Trump has been a big factor, but Democrats also have been aided by more candidates running for office and more competitive primaries than four years ago.\nWhile early voting and vote-by-mail ballots are up this year, election experts warn this doesn’t necessarily mean there will be record turnout overall in the primary. Partly, Texas voters have been shifting from voting on Election Day to voting earlier as it has become more convenient.\nEarly voting started Feb. 20 and runs through Friday. Election day is March 6.\nJeremy Wallace\nJeremy Wallace has covered politics and campaigns for more than 20 years. Before joining the Hearst Texas newspapers in 2017 he covered government and politics for the Tampa Bay Times, The Miami Herald and the Sarasota Herald-Tribune.

Their name comes from the given name Alexander, which in turn was originally derived from the Greek name, which means defender of men. In the late 11th century, Queen Margaret introduced the name, which she had heard in the Hungarian Court where she was raised, into Scotland by naming one of her sons Alexander. The popularity of the name Alexander was ensured by the fact that it was born by three Scottish kings, the first being Margaret's son who succeeded to the throne of Scotland following the death of Malcolm III.\nEarly Origins of the Alster family\nThe surname Alster was first found in Kintyre, where they held a family seat from ancient times.\n\"As a surname Alexander is very common on the west coast, where, according to the authors of Clan Donald, some of the descendants of Godfrey, second son of Alastair Mor, appear to have settled in the Carrick district of Ayrshire. \" [1]\nThe Clan MacAllistair, Alisdair being the Gaelic for Alexander, are descended from the great King Somerled. Somerled had five sons, by his marriage to Ragnhildis, daughter of the Norwegian King of the Isles, Olaf Morsel. In the MacAllister line, Ranald had two sons, Ruari and Donald, and Donald had two sons, Angus and Alisdair. Alisdair living about 1230 to 1295 claimed the territory in South Knapdale, Kintyre, the ancient Clan seat was at Ard Phadraid (Patrick's Point) on the south side of Loch Tarbot. Alisdair (known as Alisdair Mor (the big)) is the recognized founder of the Clan. On his death, his estates were given to his brother and heir who was one of Bruce's supporters, Angus Mor.\nEarly History of the Alster family\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Alster research.

Some settled in Canada as United Empire Loyalists, in the wake of the American War of Independence. Families on both sides of the border have recovered much of their heritage in the 20th century through Clan societies and highland games.

He has over twenty years experience representing individuals accused of serious drug crimes before the state courts in Houston, throughout Texas and in Federal Courts Nationwide.\nRespected and Trusted Advocate\nMr. Floyd has been featured on national television programs, world-wide radio and printed media commenting on issues relating to criminal law. He is listed in Thomson Reuters’ prominent list of Super Lawyers and many other respected publications featuring the best and brightest criminal defense lawyers in America. Mr. Floyd represents high-profile individuals, professionals, celebrities and business people who have been charged with drug crimes for whom a drug conviction could be disastrous.\nIf You Must Take Your Drug Case Seriously\nIf you have been charged with a drug crime and must take the case seriously, please contact Mr. Floyd and discuss the facts of your case and a possible successful defensive strategy.\nSerious Felony Drug Crimes in Texas\nDrug offenses in Texas are among the most serious in the state’s arsenal of criminal laws. Penalties of drug violations can be extremely severe and carry with them a host of collateral consequences.\nA drug charge in Texas does not necessarily mean a drug conviction. There are several effective defenses for narcotics offenses that a talented drug crimes attorney with experience investigating the circumstances surrounding an search and arrest for a drug crime should know and be able to use to your advantage. Mr. Floyd has published hundreds of articles relating to criminal law, search and seizure and trial procedures and can use his knowledge and experience to create a successful defense strategy and force the government to follow the law and meet its burden of proof.\nDefensive Strategies in Drug Crimes Cases\nFor instance, an knowledgeable and prepared criminal defense lawyer could demonstrate that your arresting officers did not have just cause to search your home, vehicle, or person. He could show that you were a victim of entrapment, or argue that the drugs belonged to someone else or were not intended for human consumption. It is even possible that drugs found in your vicinity, or even in your vehicle, were hidden, unknown to you and therefore not in your possession. There are many possible successful defenses n drug cases, if your lawyer dedicates the time and resources to investigate your case and is familiar with the law.\nDo Not Talk to the Police or Federal Agents without a Lawyer\nIf you believe you are being investigated for a drug trafficking crime, or have already been arrested or charged with this type of offense, consult with a knowledgeable attorney with experience in drug defenses immediately. Your lawyer can listen to your side of the story before helping you determine the best possible defense strategy in the unique circumstances of your case. With the help of a drug crimes attorney with a successful track record, you may be able to avoid crippling consequences to your freedom and future.\nTexas Drug Crime Laws\nTexas courts look at five primary factors in determining the sentence to be imposed upon a conviction of any of the above drug offenses:\nThe type of drug involved. For example, a drug found in penalty group 1 (heroin) will result in a much harsher sentence than a drug found in penalty group 3 (prescription drugs).\nThe amount of drugs involved. Greater amounts of the same drug, regardless of the penalty group, will result in a longer sentence.\nThe purpose for which the drug is used. A simple possession is less severe than intent to distribute, manufacture, or deliver drugs.\nLocation of the violation. Drugs possessed or sold near schools or day care centers, for example, are treated more harshly than on an average street corner.\nWhether the drug offense was tied to another offense. Drug offenses associated with crimes of violence or involve the possession or use of a firearm will result in a significantly more severe sentence.\nTexas Drug Statutes\nManufacture or delivery of controlled substances (drugs)\nMinimum Punishment: Confinement in jail for a term of not more than 2 years, or less than 180 days, and a fine not to exceed $10,000\nMaximum Punishment: Confinement in prison for life or for a term of not more than 99 years nor less than 15 years, and a fine not to exceed $250,000\nPossession of controlled substances (drugs)\nMinimum Punishment: Confinement in jail for a term of not more than 180 days, and a fine not to exceed $2,000 or both\nDelivery of Marijuana\nMinimum Punishment: Confinement in jail for a term of not more than 180 days, a fine not to exceed $2,000, or both\nPossession of Marijuana\nMaximum Punishment: Confinement in prison for life or for a term of not more than 99 years nor less than 5 years, and a fine not to exceed $50,000\nThese offenses are set out in Chapter 481 of Health and Safety Code. There are five penalty groups in this chapter. Each group designates the offense and punishment. The groups are governed by two factors: the type of the drug and the quantity involved. Section 481.032 contains exhaustive lists (with new drugs added each year) that are in Penalty Groups I, 1-A, 2, 3, 4, and 5.\nCONSEQUENCES OF DRUG CONVICTIONS\nThere are also many collateral consequences for having been convicted of a drug offense in Texas.\nEmployment. Many occupations (such as barber, plumber, nurse, etc.) require a license to work. Section 53.021 of the Texas Occupations Code authorize Texas licensing authorities to revoke, suspend, or deny a license to anyone convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.\nEducation: Any student convicted of the possession or sale of a controlled substance can lose or be denied financial assistance under the Federal Student Loans and Grants program, or the forfeiture of a prepaid scholarship.\nAsset forfeiture: Serious drug convictions can result of forfeiture of cash, vehicles, homes, personal property, and businesses.\nFirearm: A drug conviction of more than one year will result in loss of the right to own or possess a firearm or ammunition.\nHousing: Federal housing policies permit the exclusion of drug offenders from federally subsidized or funded housing.\nCivil rights: A drug conviction results in the loss of the right to vote, run for public office, be appointed to a public office, or serve on a jury.\nBecause of the wide range of criminal penalties associated with drug offenses and the vast array of civil penalties, disqualifications and disabilities associated flowing drug convictions (and, yes, probation is a conviction), any one charged with a drug offense needs an aggressive and experienced criminal defense attorney.\nExperienced Federal Criminal Defense Lawyer\nThere are significant misconceptions about federal crimes. Many people assume that federal crimes are “white collar” or “national security” offenses. Nothing could be further from the truth. Approximately 55% of all federal prisoners, more than 30,000 of them, stand convicted of drug offenses. The U.S. Congress has enacted 38 drug statutes that proscribe penalties and fines for 165 drug-related offenses. The high end of these offenses carries penalties of 10 years to life imprisonment with $10 to $50 million fines while the lower end of these offenses carries penalties of 3 years imprisonment and fines up to $250,000.\nCrimes with Mandatory Minimums\nBelow is a list of drug offenses that carry a mandatory minimum sentence under 28 U.S.C. § 841:\nThe mandatory minimum can be 5 to 10 years without parole depending upon the quantity of the drug involved.\nThe five-year minimum drug case can double to 10 years with one prior felony conviction while the 10-year minimum drug case can double to 20 years with a prior felony conviction.\nBoth the five-year and ten-year minimum cases increase to a mandatory minimum of 20 years if a death results. The minimum increases to life without parole if both a death results and the offender has one prior felony conviction.\nFinally, the ten-year mandatory minimum drug type increases to life without parole if the offender has two or more prior felony convictions.\nDrug sentencing Reform in Debate\nCurrently pending before Congress is the Smarter Sentencing Act that would cut in half the length of many drug sentences, but a significant group of lawmakers oppose the Act, labeling its supporters as being part of a “leniency industrial complex.”\nForfeiture of Property and Money\nAs with Texas drug convictions, federal drug convictions can also lead to civil forfeitures that result in the loss of personal property, including cash, homes, vehicles, planes, and other personal belongings\nThe proceeds from forfeited property go into the coffers of law enforcement agencies, not the government treasury. Thus, the police have an incentive to seize and forfeit as much property as possible, regardless of whether it is actually tied to an offender’s drug activity.\nDrug Convictions can Destroy Lives, Professions\nBeyond these serious to severe penal consequences, federal drug convictions have significant personal collateral consequences. They can disqualify you for a job in the health care industry, government, private security, law enforcement, many areas of the criminal justice system, and any other job requiring a security clearance.\nThey can, and most likely will, have adverse impact on your employment prospects with companies that routinely run criminal background checks prior to their decision to hire. They can also have a serious impact on your ability to rent a suitable residence as property owners also frequently run background checks, refusing to rent or lease to drug offenders.\nFederal Drug Task Forces\nFederal and state law enforcement officials often work together on drug enforcement offenses. They generally employ “task forces” that generally target one individual with the hope that he or she will lead them to a wider network of suspects. The primary objective of these kinds of investigation is to develop reasonable, articulable suspicion to arrest the initial target with the hopes that law enforcement can pressure the individual into cooperating with them to make a case against the wider network.\nContact a Criminal Defense Lawyer with Experience Defending Drug Cases\nIf you find yourself in a position facing a serious drug charge, you should immediately seek a qualified criminal defense lawyer who has experience defending individuals accused of serious drug charges. A skilled criminal defense attorney is more likely than not to develop a successful defense strategy against the drug charge, or, in the correct circumstances, to have the charge dismissed altogether.\nPossible Defenses\nDefenses against drug charges include: unlawful search and seizures, faulty crime lab analysis, lost or tampered with evidence, drugs that were planted, drugs that belonged to someone else, entrapment, or the medical marijuana exception.\nDeveloping these defenses requires a criminal defense lawyer who has the knowledge and experienced necessary to apply the law to your case. In the proper circumstances your lawyer should have access to a team of investigators, paralegals, and experts, who can assist in providing a vigorous and thorough defense investigation, strategy preparation and trial plan that will lead to a successful outcome in the case.\nDedicated to the Best Possible Outcome\nThe primary goal of the John T. Floyd Law Firm is to produce the best outcome possible for our clients: dismissal of charges, acquittal at trial, verdict of a lesser offense, or the lowest sentence possible should a guilty verdict be rendered.\nWe Fight to get Our Clients out on Bail\nA successful defense in a serious drug case begins with efforts to get you released on bail as soon as possible.\nObviously, detention in jail pending trial is not the best situation for our clients. No one wants to spend a day in jail. But pre-trail detention also interferes with our ability to communicate freely with our client and interferes with their ability to assist in preparing a defense. Pretrial detention is not good for the client, not good for the defensive strategy and interferes with personal obligations. Therefore, we demand bail in every case possible.\nToo Many Guilty Pleas\n97 percent of all federal drug offenders plead guilty to a reduced charge or to a lower recommended sentence than would result from a trial. We do not, however, undertake a plea bargain strategy unless our client directs us to do so. If the Government proffers a deal, we are ethically bound to convey that deal to you. At that point it is our duty to convey to the client the pros and cons of such a agreement, including the legal ramifications and consequences of a guilty plea. But the ultimate decision to enter into a plea bargain rests exclusively with you. It is your life and we will respect whatever decision you make regarding plea agreement or trial, will stand behind you 100 percent and will fight for the best possible result under the circumstances.\nSystem Not Always Fair and Just\nOur legal system is supposed to be fair and just. We know that is not always the case. Our duty, as criminal defense attorneys, is to fight for the fairness and justice that the Government is not always willing to extend to our clients. The Government’s prosecution of drug crimes is often rife with prosecutorial misconduct, unethical behavior before and during the trial, and an overzealousness that translates into downright meanness. We provide our clients a safeguard against these Government actions.\nProudly Fighting for the Rights of the Accused\nAt the John T. Floyd Law Firm, we are dedicated to protecting the rights of people accused of drug crimes in both state and federal courts. Our firm is headed by John T. Floyd, a Houston-based criminal lawyer who has helped countless clients across Texas defeat drug charges of all kinds, from complicated international drug trafficking and distribution cases down to minor possession charges that would have had a major impact of the lives of our clients.\nWe Will Fight for You\nMr. Floyd and his legal team have the experience, talent, and knowledge you need to fight back against overzealous prosecutors and law enforcement agents. With John T. Floyd in your corner, you will be in the best position possible to have your drug crime charges dismissed or reduced and avoid the life-altering penalties to your freedom and future.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1142576"}

(“CEMEX”) (NYSE: CX) announced today a new Climate Action strategy, which outlines the company´s vision to advance towards a carbon-neutral economy and to address society’s increasing demands more efficiently. In CEMEX, we believe that climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time and support the urgency of collective action.\nAs a result of our efforts to date, we have reduced our net specific CO2 emissions by more than 22% compared to our 1990 baseline. But we acknowledge that this is not enough. This is why we have defined a more ambitious target of a 35% reduction of net specific CO2 emissions by 2030. This new goal is aligned with the Science-Based Targets methodology, a requirement climate science says is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.\nTo complement this strategy with a longer-term vision, CEMEX is also establishing a new ambition to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050. In our business, we believe concrete—our end product—has a key role to play in the transition to a carbon-neutral economy, and is an essential component in the development of climate-smart urban projects, sustainable buildings, and resilient infrastructure.\n“Climate change has been a priority for CEMEX for many years. Our efforts have brought significant progress to date, but we must do more. This is why we have defined a more ambitious strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 and to deliver net-zero CO2 concrete by 2050,” said Fernando A. Gonzalez, CEO of CEMEX.\nTo fulfill this strategy, we have a detailed CO2 roadmap to accelerate the roll-out of proven technologies in all of our facilities, including investing in energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, expanding the use of renewable energy, and increasing the substitution of clinker with alternative cementitious materials.\nFurthermore, our new net-zero CO2 concrete aspiration for 2050 sets us on a path of open innovation that requires strategic partnerships and cross-industry collaboration in the development of breakthrough technologies like carbon capture, utilization, and storage; novel clinkers with low heat consumption, alternative decarbonated raw materials, carbonation of concrete waste for use as recycled aggregates, and the promotion of circular economy models that transform waste into fuel. CEMEX currently consumes as either alternative fuel or alternative raw material 32 times more waste from other industries than the waste it generates and sends to landfill.\nFor more information on the company’s new Climate Action strategy, please visit: www.cemex.com/climate-action\nCEMEX is a global building materials company that provides high-quality products and reliable services.

The structure was built by Colonel Archibald McAllister in the early 19th century on his plantation along North Front Street in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Col. McAllister started his plantation at the site of a French and Indian War fort in about 1787 by building a large stone house at the junction of Fishing Creek and the Susquehanna River. He was a very successful entrepreneur with his farming activities, eventually his operations included a grist and saw mill, a blacksmith shop and a tavern.\nThe smoke house was described in the agricultural newspaper Cultivator by Daniel Chandler in 1835 based on his visit to the farm in 1828. He described Col. McAllister as “a gentlemen of science and refined observation”. Chandler was especially impressed with his household conveniences notably the milk house, smoke house and clothes line, describing each in detail. The smoke house “was a wooden octagon building ….. perfectly tight except the door-way”. Chandler noted that the smoke house was unique in that it was elevated off the ground by a foot or more and that “no fire was admitted into the building” therefore reducing the chances of the building catching fire. The smoke for curing the meats was introduced into the building by a tube from a stove in an adjacent room. Typically, in a conventional smokehouse the smoke is generated by a brick fireplace in the center of the earthen floor or by an iron stove in the building. It was noted that McAllister’s arrangement provided a perfectly dry building allowing him to store his meats in the smokehouse until they were consumed.\nThe smokehouse foundation is not an artifact in the traditional sense, but is an archaeological feature, a technical term that applies to objects such as post molds, foundations, walk ways, roads and other remains that cannot be removed from the site. This treasure is the rocks which form the foundation of a structure – as in this case the base for the smokehouse. The archaeological footprint of Col. McAllister’s innovative smoke house design consists of a circular stone foundation 12 feet in diameter allowing for the unique octagonal building. The connecting room for the stove can be seen in the picture as an “L” shaped alignment of rocks to the right of the main foundation.\nExcavations at Fort Hunter will continue weekdays 9am - 4pm, through October 7th.\nLabels: Archaeology, Fort Hunter, State Museum of Pennsylvania\nIn the Public’s Eye - Out an...","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line292699"}

After a 1997 redesign that involved the adoption of a Ram-like front end, the Dodge Dakota was offered with a regular and Club Cab model.\nWith the regular cab version of the 1998 Dakota, a 6.5-foot and 8-foot bed box was available. For 1998, the performance ante of the medium-sized pickup truck was raised by the presence of an R/T version of the Dakota with a 250-horsepower 5.9-liter Magnum V-8 powerplant.\nA 5.2-liter Magnum V-8 engine also available for the 1998 Dodge Dakota pickup truck. Before the Chevrolet Colorado SS models arrival in 2009, the Dakota was the only commonly available mid-sized pickup truck in the United States with a V-8 engine. Other powerplants available on the 1998 Dakota also included a 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a 3.9-liter V-6 engine.\nRear-wheel drive as well as a part-time four-wheel drive system allowed power to the ground. For the 2000 model year, a four-door Quad Cab version of the Dodge Dakota was introduced. Also in 2000, the trucks 5.2-liter V-8 engine was replaced by a new 4.7-liter displacement PowerTech V-8. Given a new look mirroring its full-sized Dodge truck counterpart, the Dakota was refreshed in 2005 with an all-new suspension. The regular cab version of the Dakota was discontinued on the newer model leaving the Club Cab and Quad Cab.\nEngine choice for the 2005 Dodge Dakota consisted of a 3.7-liter V-6 or the 4.7-liter V-8 powerplant rated at up to 260 horsepower and 310 pound-feet of torque. In 2010, the truck division of Dodge was divided into the Ram brand. As a result, the Dakota could be considered a Ram product for its final two years on sale. With dropping customer popularity, the Dakotas production ended after the 2011 model year.\nSee More Dodge Models and Years\nDodge Dakota","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1751058"}

It is the oldest monumental fountain in Paris and a focal point for the groups of young people that gather there.\nThe other day I saw a very old map of the city. I noticed that the square was marked as a cemetery, and it included a church named after the Holy Innocents. Innocents refers to the male infants King Herod ordered massacred, according to the biblical narrative.\nI did some research and discovered that the space had indeed been a burial ground from the Middle Ages until the late 18th century. It was then condemned as a health hazard.\nThe corpses and bones were subsequently exhumed and transported to underground storage near Montparnasse, on the other side of the city. This site is now known as the Catacombs and open to the public as a tourist attraction. The Innocents church was demolished and the fountain moved to the centre, where it still stands.\nI’m now half way through a 2011 novel on the exhumation, by Booker Prize nominated British writer Andrew Miller. Titled Pure, it recreates the story of the removal of the corpses, which it depicts as a purification.\nThis took place on the eve of the French Revolution, which could crudely be described as the forces of reason replacing the cloud of religious superstition. A purification of sorts, though the term refers more directly to the foul smell that permeated the area. It would turn fresh produce rotten and taint the breath of the residents.\nThe main character is a young engineer named Jean-Baptiste Baratte, a fervent believer in rationality. The family he boards with are given to superstition and are hostile to his work once they discover what it is.\nMy interest is heightened by the coincidence concerning the historic Camperdown cemetery at the top of my street in Sydney. In the late 1940s, ghost stories and a murder led to demands for the ‘purification’ of a large section of the site.\nThis took the form of the transfer of headstones to the area next to adjacent church, and use of the space for the creation of the Camperdown Memorial Rest Park. Today it’s a well frequented meeting place for young people and dog owners.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line168312"}

I'm Edward Luce, the US political commentator. I'm joined by my colleague Rana Foroohar, FT columninst and also fellow contributor to Swamp Notes, our newsletter, James Politi, one of the bureau chiefs here in Washington DC, and our guest today, Norm Ornstein, one of the best, most experienced scholars of American politics and also participant in American political reform and the author of, amongst many books, It's Even Worse Than it Looks.\nWell, I don't know what, Norm, your view is going to be on this week's election. Maybe that title won't describe it. But it has been a pretty surprising and a pretty remarkable midterm election. We were all... the conventional wisdom, at least, was anticipating a red tsunami, a red wave, a shellacking, a thumping.\nAnd what we've seen is something quite different, the least different, the least bad performance by a president in the midterms for 20 years, the least bad by a Democrat. Democratic president for 40 years. So Joe Biden, once again, has defied very, very low expectations.\nAlso an extremely bad night for Donald Trump. Not only did most of his favourite candidates, the more Trumpian candidates, like Don Bolduc in New Hampshire, Doug Mastriano, for the governorship in Pennsylvania, and many, many others across the board, lose, or look likely to lose, but Ron DeSantis, his potential challenger for the 2024 nomination, had a massive landslide to be re-elected as governor of Florida.\nRupert Murdoch also seems to have turned on Donald Trump. The New York Post's headline this morning is Humpty Trumpty. And just to finish off the poem, all the king's horses and all the king's men could not put Trumpty together again. So Norm, let me start with a question, a very direct question for you about Trump is, is this the beginning of the end for Donald Trump?\nSo when I saw the New York Post headline, my comment was, oh, a lover's quarrel.\nOf course, Rupert has dumped many in the past. But this is a really bad time for Trump. And we saw this on Fox and other places, even on Fox, that they were saying on election eve, where they had expected this red tsunami, that Trump was to blame. Trump himself had said, if we win, you can thank me, if we lose, blame somebody else, which was classic Trump.\nBut we also have to keep in mind what's lurking in the background, here. And it's not just whether Republicans have decided that he is a drag on their chances rather than a boost, but we've got indictments looming, many indictments looming, Georgia, to start with. And from everything we know about what Fani Willis, the prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, has said and done, probably fairly quickly there.\nThe Justice Department has moved slowly but almost certainly we will see indictments there. We know in New York that they've basically taken over his business. And it's quite possible that the Trump organisation will be dissolved.\nTrump is on a downward slide into some very bad things and very bad times. But Trumpism is still not dead. And that's the important part of this, Ed. If somehow Donald Trump just disappeared from the face of the Earth tomorrow, the pathologies in the American political system are there. And they're in many ways, more dangerous.\nAnd we can talk about that more. In spite of an election that, as you said, was a stunningly good one, in perspective, for Joe Biden and his presidency, although we're going to talk about the bumps in the road that will follow from that.\nBut we may still see Kari Lake, one of the most dangerous election deniers, win a governorship in Arizona. We've got some other races that are hanging in the balance. The cultural problems, the divide in the country, is still great enough that I'm not getting the good night's sleep that I had hoped I would even after an election that turned out to be less dangerous than we had thought.\nYou make a very good point that DeSantis and others are not auditioning to kill Trumpism. They're auditioning to be the new heads of the MAGA movement. And that's - we will get on to - and maybe James and Rana will have views on DeSantis in a moment. But just as a quick follow up, midterm elections for first-time incumbent presidents are traditionally seen as a referendum on those presidents.\nAnd clearly this became more of a split-screen midterm election because of Trump. And the party was in a complete panic on Monday night when it looked like Trump might actually announce his candidacy for 2024 and completely intrude on...\nFair to say, therefore, that the difference between what the conventional wisdom was expecting to happen on Tuesday night, which is this red wave, and what actually happened, which is this far more calibrated, even, outcome, that Trump was the difference, or are there other factors, such as the abortion Supreme Court ruling that played a role here, Norm?\nThere are definitely other factors. And I think the conventional wisdom believe that with Biden's approval rating in the low 40s, with a number of polls showing that the top issues were inflation, the economy, and crime, that the other things wouldn't matter.\nBut those other things, starting with the Dobbs decision and the abortion issue, including what now, for a lot of Democrats and independents, was a concern over the radical direction that the Republican party had taken, a substantial turnout among younger voters, more than we had expected, which I think was driven significantly by the abortion issue out there, all of that made a difference and turned it into a different kind of election.\nAnd I think we can talk more about the realities that it's not a uniform, national result, Florida going dramatically further in a red direction, Ohio, where you had a Senate candidate, a Democrat, Tim Ryan, who ran the best campaign of anybody this time against JD Vance, who ran a horrible campaign and who's a horrible person.\nBut Vance still won pretty comfortably because it's still a tribal world. And Ohio, which was once a swing state, is becoming firmly Republican as well, while we saw dramatically different results in places like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and in Minnesota.\nIt's not clear that there is a national set of issues themselves that can explain everything. But there's no doubt in my mind that if the Supreme Court had not ruled the way it did on Dobbs, we'd be looking at a much worse result for Democrats, as we look at it today.\nSo you mentioned Florida. Rana, I know you've also been paying attention to the pretty extraordinary Republican performance there, no longer a swing state. It's very clearly a red state now, as Ohio is.\nOne of the silver linings, perhaps - and you and I have talked about this and written about this - is, to America's political polarisation, is that the racial polarisation isn't as great. You do have a lot more Hispanics voting Republican. And you even have some African-Americans moving over into the Republican column. But this is particularly true for Hispanics in Florida. What do you think explains that?\nSo it's really interesting. For viewers who are listening, Ed and I actually did a Swamp Note on this a few days ago. And Ed, you posed, I think, quite correctly, that Hispanics are not a single block and that Democrats really hadn't gotten that. We've seen them vote totally differently in different parts of the country, in the Midwest, in Florida, in Texas. And this reflects the fact that they're coming from different places, from different socio-economic groups, with different kinds of interests.\nI've often thought in general that Democrats do better focusing on issues of class rather than slicing and dicing identity. I've thought for years that's made things very divisive within the party and has taken the party in the wrong way and alienated a lot of people. I think that's particularly true when you're dealing with the Hispanic community.\nI grew up in the rural Midwest, in Indiana, and there are a lot of Hispanics there that are small business owners, they're migrants. They still believe in the American Dream. They would respond to a message of less regulation, lower taxes, more than they might respond to social issues and identity messages. And I think that Florida reflects that.\nI'm also just fascinated - and I would love to hear what Norm thinks about this too - by the meaning of Florida. Florida has become the anti California, the anti New York. It's like the conservative answer to everything that they would believe is wrong with a place like, where I'm sitting, Park Slope, Brooklyn or San Francisco.\nIt's low taxes, private sector, we don't care if there's another hurricane, we're not going to worry about who can get flood insurance or not, but we're open for business and the money is pouring in. Now whether the latest crypto boom is going to be the beginning of the end of some of that or - I should say bust - is going to be the beginning of the end of some of that, I'm curious.\nBut there's a kind of, as always, with Florida, a no-holds-barred, live life, be prosperous, and it's almost a libertarian vibe. And Norm, I'm curious if you would say the same.\nSo Florida is fascinating. We used to think of Florida, when we thought of it as a swing state, of being multiple states. Miami-Dade County, it was a solidly blue area. Then you'd move to the panhandle, Pensacola, which was extraordinarily red. The middle of the state was more red. Miami-Dade County went red this time.\nBut beyond that, and there's some, perhaps, funny, good news for Democrats in all of this because I think one of the reasons that Florida moved from purple to red is that a lot of Republicans moved from Pennsylvania and Michigan and New York and New Jersey, down to Florida. And that provided enough of a cushion that the Democrats could do better in those states.\nEven having said that, that Ron DeSantis won so handily against a former governor who actually was fairly popular when he was governor, is striking, and that Marco Rubio, another example, an incumbent Senator but who - when Trump labelled him 'Little Marco,' it stuck in a lot of ways - running against what ought to have been a perfect Democratic nominee, Val Demings, a former police chief, a member of Congress, who ran quite an effective campaign. And she lost by a big margin as well.\nAnd that's really a sign that Florida has become a Republican state, period, I think for all the reasons you say, Rana. And I think if we look at Hispanics there, which is.. and that's a polyglot. We have Venezuelans and Guatemalans, a lot of Cubans, obviously, that they have turned as much as they have, I think, is a reflection of the fact that Republicans have very skillfully used the word 'socialism' to their advantage.\nAnd Democrats missed a beat in Florida this time. Recall that Ron DeSantis basically kidnapped a bunch of asylum seekers in Texas, dragooned them into or lured them to Florida the same way that the old man would lure a child into a van with candy..\n...and then flew them, using a large amount of taxpayer money, to Martha's Vineyard but... and called them illegal immigrants. These were Venezuelans fleeing the Maduro regime and going through enormous hardship to get to the United States to seek asylum.\nAnd that Democrats didn't pound away at that and say, Ron DeSantis, you're giving aid and comfort to Maduro, you want to talk about socialism, was political malpractice, not that it would have made all the difference but it's pretty clear that Democrats, if they're ever going to get back into the game in Florida, are going to have to do something about those Hispanics in Miami-Dade.\nCan I ask one question, just on the back of that? Why did the Democrats in Martha's Vineyard not show up and - where immigrants are being shipped off - not show up and say, thank you, we have a labour shortage in this country. We desperately need immigration. Please, hey, we're going to put these folks to work in the hospitality industry, here. Why did they not make just a huge political boondoggle of that?\nDemocrats are not very good at messaging, as we say. Now you could say they're terrible at messaging. They still did better than Barack Obama's midterm elections, when presumably, they were better at messaging than Bill Clinton, who was great at messaging. So we can't blame everything on that, or wherever they lost on that. But there was a tone deafness there to the opportunities available.\nAnd the same is true, let me say, Val Demings, in a debate with Marco Rubio, took on the crime issue by turning it into a gun issue and did it extraordinarily effectively. And there Democrats are on really solid ground. The overwhelming majority of Americans are appalled by the way guns have been out there and assault weapons killing people. They want background checks. They want bans on assault weapons.\nThat's the way to hit the crime issue. And they didn't do that at all. And that hurt, I think, in a number of places where - the last thing you want, in a campaign, is to be on the defensive. You want your opponents to be on the defensive. And that's an area where they're going to have to do some additional work.\nSo a very good point. And with all these instances of Democratic malpractice, to still get this result does bring us back to Donald Trump, I think. And James, you've been travelling a lot around the campaign, trail to the swing states. You've seen Trump. You've seen DeSantis.\nIf, as expected, Trump still goes ahead, ignores the advice of pretty much every senior Republican, and still goes ahead with his 2024 campaign launch in Mar-a-Lago next Tuesday - and I guess knowing what we know about Trump and his stubbornness and his pride, it's likely he will go ahead - then what would you imagine a DeSantis-Trump full-on battle looking like? Would Trump just blow him away? Does MAGA still... does the MAGA heart still beat with Trump or is that changing?\nWell, it's hard to tell at the moment. In a way, we've been here before in the sense that there have been other moments when, after electoral defeats, some Republicans have blamed Trump. And then he's continued to plough ahead because he has such a strong hold on the base.\nThe latest polling out, from Morning Consult, this morning, showed that Trump still has over 50 per cent of support for 2024 nomination compared to DeSantis, who has edged up, but is about roughly half that, half that level. And you can see how a sustained campaign by Fox and the Murdoch media and the conservative universe to get rid of Trump, in a certain sense, could have an impact on those numbers and really elevate DeSantis.\nBut I think that there's still a question about whether DeSantis will really survive the first big contacts with Trump. And we saw, there was a first swipe from Trump over the weekend, calling him Ron Desanctimonious. That didn't really seem to stick on Tuesday, but...\nToo many syllables, Ron\nSo that was a bit of a swing and a miss from Trump. But I don't know if the next swings are going to miss in the same way. And also, we don't really know if DeSantis really has it in him to take on Trump.\nHe's had opportunities, in previous moments, over the course of the year, to really criticise Trump or to take him on, such as the Mar-a-Lago raid, the January 6 hearings. He could have tried to hit him a little bit when he was down and he declined to do that. And he's been biding his time, maybe wisely picking his moment.\nBut we don't know, really, if DeSantis has the fight in him to go after Trump head on. And he still hasn't formally announced his candidacy. There are super PACs, donors, who are egging him on, trying to get him to make the first move. Maybe he's waiting for Trump to implode a little bit before going after him. Maybe that's the right approach. But we still haven't seen that big, big clash yet. And we don't really know how, once they're in the ring, how it's going to go.\nNorm, I'd like your thoughts on that, whether DeSantis has got the mojo. It seems to me, though, while agreeing with everything that James just said, that Trump might be putting him in the race by himself. DeSantis is being attacked so frequently and viscerally, and there's that tone of menace that Trump has when he targets a rival, that DeSantis just may have no choice but to be his rival. He's being attacked.\nNorm, I'm might be interested in your thoughts on that but also on your thoughts about Biden's declaration for 2024. He obviously looks stronger now. He continually confounds low expectations. And I think one of the key elements of Tuesday - and others have said this - is that a lot of people hate Trump. Of course, a lot of people adore Trump too. Nobody really hates Biden.\nAnd that's... it was very interesting to see one of Fox's stars, Jesse Watters, saying, well, there isn't this visceral hatred of Biden the way there was of Obama. And I thought, gee, I wonder why?\nThat's another angle here. On DeSantis, I think the attacks by Trump are good for him and here's why. Remember when Trump ran in 2016 and the Republican establishment was appalled? But what Trump did on the debate stage was to go after all the other Republicans, giving them nicknames, attacking them. And that was appealing to a group of Republicans who wanted a tough guy who was going to rip apart the opposition and blow up the establishment.\nRon DeSantis, despite doing some really horrific things in Florida, has had this popularity there, I think in part because he's seen as being tough. And if he takes on Trump and wins, that's going to be a positive for him with the rest of the electorate.\nHaving said that, anybody who watched the debate that Trump had with Charlie Crist, or that DeSantis had with Charlie Crist, he was not ready for primetime. He did very poorly. It's not clear to me that if you put him in the national spotlight, that the sort of chicanery that he uses with press conferences in Florida, where nobody is able to ask any questions, where he gets all the police behind him or when he signs a Don't Say Gay bill, having a bunch of little kids sitting around him, when he's under that scrutiny and really being pushed - and that means being pushed by Republicans, his rivals, because it's not just Trump.\nI've been actually gobsmacked to watch Mike Pence, out there now trying to make his pitch, basically, as a gentler version of Trump, having had Trump really call for him being hanged, but now saying nice things. But Mike Pence may have a little bit of a following out there. And Nikki Haley is out there.\nAnd Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, who's trying to be the nicer version of Trump - he's a full-on Trumpist but he has a fleece vest and he looks less menacing - all of them are going to be stirring things up. And whether DeSantis can make it through all of that is a real question mark.\nFrom the perspective of Democrats, first of all, the more they fight amongst themselves and the more they take on Trump, given what James said, which I think is entirely accurate, that for all of the travails of Donald Trump, for all of the reality that even Rupert Murdoch and his cronies are turning on him, Trump still has this deep following in the electorate with Republicans in the electorate.\nThere's still this outrage and a belief that he had his election stolen. They're going to be rising up when he is indicted. And if he stays in this game you're going to see a deep division among Republicans. That doesn't mean that they won't be united when it comes to actually voting in November of 2024. But from the perspective of Democrats, if they're in an internal battle that becomes really vicious, that's not such a bad thing.\nIn a moment, I'm going to ask Rana and you about the next Congress. But James, just whilst we're still focused on what the outcome of the midterm elections were, we're going to get another Senate runoff in Georgia between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker. Last time, of course, it decided the Senate. Those two runoffs going to the Democrats meant the Democrats had majority control.\nIt might boil down to - depending on what happens in Arizona, where they're still counting and in Nevada, where they're still counting - it could once again boil down to a Georgia runoff to decide which party controls the Senate. And now, clearly, you're going to be going down there and covering this. But tell me, what is your hunch about this Walker-Warnock run off? And will Trump get involved again because I suspect viewers will need no reminding, his involvement in the last runoffs caused Republicans to lose, becoming a very familiar story.\nWell, I think a lot will depend on whether it will be a decisive election for... a decisive runoff for control of the Senate. I think that if it's not decisive, if the Democrats have already gotten to 50, I think that most likely, Warnock will rather comfortably hold his seat just because you won't get that sense, from the Republicans, that this is the only way that they can... this is their path to gain control. You won't get as much national attention. And on that score, I think Warnock will do better.\nWhat I found... but on the other hand, if it will decide the fate of the Senate, I think that there's just going to be a massive amount of money, a huge effort. It'll be the Republican chance to reset the narrative in terms of what happened in this election. And I have to say, even though Herschel/Walker is a real classic - in some ways, classic Trump-backed candidate, it's very striking that he's at 48 per cent, 49 per cent.\nIn Georgia, it's a very fiercely-divided, ideological... this is the real battleground of American politics at the moment. Everyone feels very strongly about winning and prevailing. And I think Republican voters are willing to... they're willing to go with Walker if it means that they can overcome, win a Senate Majority.\nOf course, if it's not decisive, then I think plenty of Republican voters will stay home. They don't really like Walker as much as they like Brian Kemp, the governor. But they would take him, I think, if it's a decisive race.\nOK, let's move on to the next Congress. So Rana, assuming that Republicans do end up with a House majority, a very slim one, presumably, of 5-6, and that Kevin McCarthy becomes speaker, a very weakened speaker, I would presume because that slim margin will strengthen the far right, the Freedom Caucus, the Jim Jordans, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes, et cetera, what, if anything, other than performative impeachments, can we expect from a Congress like that?\nThat's a great question. In some ways, I think that there's going to be a continued bipartisan consensus over China. I think that that's actually interestingly, for a midterm, China was a campaign issue in about one fifth of the swing states, which is... that's something that comes up during presidentials but it's not such a big midterm issue.\nNext week, you're going to see the US-China Commission coming out on Wednesday with another report. It's going to be hawkish. It's going to be very bipartisan. And so I'm going to be interested to see, to the extent that we are moving into a more localised and more regionalised world, that decoupling is continuing, how does the rhetoric and the policy of that play out?\nAnd this is something that you and I discussed a bit in a past Swamp Note in the Ohio election, right, because that was Vance versus Tim Ryan. And both of them were saying, look, we need to reindustrialise the US. We need to... Vance being belligerent, America-first MAGA, Ryan taking a more constructive approach, but basically the same policies around trade. I think that you're going to see everybody rowing in that direction. It's just the tenor of it that will be different, depending on who you're talking about.\nThat's a very interesting point. In particular, I think it is worth emphasising that Ryan's defeat to Vance, whatever it's, seven points, correct me if I'm wrong, Norm, was considerably narrower margin of victory than Mike DeWine for the governorship, which is something like a 26-point margin for the Republican governor.\nSo Norm, Kevin McCarthy, you are one of the leading experts on Congress in the world. Kevin McCarthy, is it a safe bet he'll be speaker, assuming they have the majority? And if so, what will he have to do to keep his speakership?\nSo we know that the several of the Freedom Caucus members have already indicated that they're going to try to reinstate a rule that would keep Kevin McCarthy on a very short leash, that would allow for a vote at any time to remove a speaker if they don't like what's going on. And that's a shot across his bow.\nBut I've been around Congress for more than 50 years. And I've never seen a leader as weak or as craven as Kevin McCarthy. And that's saying something because there have been plenty of contenders for that position.\nHe achieved his position, not because of his tactical brilliance, his depth of knowledge, but because he was one of these people who kept tabs on all of the members, knew the birthdays, would send cards when their kids graduated from school or won a medal in an athletic competition. He is a glad hander. And it is trying to appease everybody, that is his trademark.\nAnd even if the majority were larger, the reality is that the Republican party in Congress has been taken over by the radical, election-denying MAGA faction. The Freedom Caucus started in 2015 because the existing rightwing caucus, the Republican Study Committee, wasn't right wing enough.\nWe've already seen a couple of groups form that believe that the Freedom Caucus isn't right wing enough. And the pressure on him from that faction, with no margin for error in what he's trying to do, will be intense.\nWhat he's already done is to try to appease that group by giving a lot of slack to the craziest of his members, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Matt Gaetz, and some of the others. He is going to give them prominent positions. He's going to focus on doing these hearings, not just about Hunter Biden but about Afghanistan and about the Justice Department.\nHe's not going to be able to be in a position to be responsible, if responsibility is what's important. And as you and I have talked before, Ed, and as I've written, my greatest fear is that if you have a divided government, you don't have the power to enact legislation yourself. You can use the investigative tools to drive the other side crazy and to bring them to their knees.\nBut your biggest power is the negative one of being able to block things. And that includes blocking spending. And it includes this odd device of the debt ceiling, which in 2011, when the Tea Party group came in with a midterm that was disastrous for Barack Obama, we came this close to a default, which would shake up the international financial community and the international economy in ways well beyond the United States. That would be a tsunami that would hit a lot of different shores.\nAnd I'm not sure that they're going to be able to avoid it. And what we have to keep in mind is, next Congress, where we are very likely to have that narrow Republican majority in the House, potentially in the Senate, that's the 118th. We will still have the 117th with a narrow Democratic majority in the House and a 50/50 Senate, where they still control it, until January 3.\nThe Democrats are going to have to find ways to head off the worst-case scenarios that back in 2011, the Republican speaker, John Boehner, managed to keep us from going over the cliff into default. Kevin McCarthy couldn't do that. And so there's going to be a big burden on Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer during this period of time.\nIf the Republicans somehow take the Senate, in early December, with that race in Georgia, then there will be no confirmations of judges or executive appointees for Joe Biden for two years. And if he wants and needs somebody in a cabinet post, for example, if it's vacated, they're going to try and hold that hostage and blackmail him into doing things that he doesn't want to do.\nSo they're going to have to work night and day, through December, to be able to head off some of the worst things. And whether all of those Democrats in the Senate - you need every single one - who want to take time off before they start the next time around, are going to be willing to do that, is another challenge.\nBiden's got plenty of headaches ahead. It was a wonderful night for him in many respects. But we cannot ignore the traumas and dangers ahead that come even with a two-vote Republican margin in the House.\nEd, can I just amplify one thing that Norm said? Because I completely agreed with your point about the financial market fallout of the debt-ceiling issues. And I think there is always fallout.\nThis time around, it's going to be hyper amplified by the fact that there is already a huge issue in international markets about trust in the US government. And you're seeing that in the volatility of the T-bill space. You're seeing that in growing concerns about the US fiscal position, particularly in the midst of decoupling, in the midst of who knows what in Taiwan. So I think it would have, actually, a really amplified effect this time.\nThat's a very, very good point. And I've heard that as they're looking at the lame-duck session between now and early January, Schumer and Pelosi, and James, I want you to respond to this, are thinking, really, of three priorities. First is to try and raise the debt ceiling now. The second is to try and prefund some of the Ukraine military and financial assistance because the MAGA wing of the Republican party is Putinista. A lot of it is pro Putin.\nAnd then third is slightly more esoteric, but maybe more important than the first two combined, is to reform the Electoral Count Act so that some of the discrepancies that led to, or could lead to another January 6, 2021, are just ruled out. James, are you hearing these things? And do you think that passage of any one or all of those three, in the lame-duck session, is realistic?\nI think I could see some sort of, in an optimistic scenario, I could see some sort of package coming together along those lines. But the problem is that there won't be much time left because I think they will want to wait until after the Georgia runoff to make some kind of calculation, actually, about what they want to do and how they want to do it, what kind of compromises need to be made.\nAnd on the debt ceiling, I don't think that there's a consensus, really, within the Democratic party about whether you want to be responsible and go ahead and raise it and take it off the table, or whether you want to use it as leverage, in a certain sense, to be able to depict the Republicans as the extremist brinkmanship champions of Congress. And I think that that's a decision that Biden and the Democrats are going to have to make.\nI think that it's in a way, it's not just about the debt ceiling when it comes to economic and financial issues for Biden. If we faced any kind of even other financial meltdown, I think that it would be very difficult for the White House and the administration to respond to it if... you couldn't see a scenario, like the Wall-Street bailout, where Janet Yellen goes begging for McCarthy to pass a rescue bill for the financial sector, and that he would say yes.\nIt would be much harder for anything like that to happen. Even something like the auto-sector bailout... would be very difficult to see if there was a recession. And so I think that from the economic point of view, Biden will have much less flexibility to respond to any kind of crisis.\nI think that's absolutely correct. Now just bearing in mind, we've got about 16, 17 minutes left. But we do have questions coming from viewers. And I'm going to throw them in here and there.\nI want to ask both Norm and Rana the big, Biden question on whether there's a deeper bench of potential successors for a competitive Democratic primary emerging. Gretchen Whitmer is performing exceptionally well in Michigan. Michigan, for the first time in decades, has a Democratic trifecta. They won back control of both chambers there, as well as her being re-elected. She's quite a strong figure.\nPeople mentioned Gavin Newsom in the Senate. Of course, there's Amy Klobuchar. Goodness knows, maybe even Bernie Sanders would try again. But the question to both of you, starting with Norm, is, will Trump, sorry, will Biden declare his candidacy? Will he run again? And...\n...run again? So will he and should he, Norm?\nSo I'm hearing from a lot of Democrats who are saying, well, he should just take himself out of it now. He's at a good point. I doubt very much that's going to happen.\nThe history that we have with presidents either in their second terms or who say they're not going to run again, that lame-duck status weakens you in a lot of respects. Now he's going to have all these issues that we know with a divided government.\nBut I would be sceptical, barring a health challenge that emerges, that he's going to announce anything one way or the other. And one of the reasons is that if you're not running, then everybody else comes right out of the woodwork to jockey for position and you have big, internal tensions that emerge.\nThe Democrats have a dilemma, here. If Joe Biden were to run again-- and what happens in 2023 is going to have a lot to do with whether he's even in a position to be able to do that-- he would be 86 at the end of his second term. That's pushing it, even in an era where 60 is the new 30 and 70 is the new 40. But 86 ain't the new 50.\nAt the same time, you have an heir apparent. And the reality is that Kamala Harris, who is the first woman of colour to be vice president, is not a strong presidential candidate. And if you have a bitter dispute among Democrats and in the aftermath of the Dobbs decision on abortion, you bypass a woman and pick a man as your presidential candidate at a time when you need a base that's enthusiastic, you're going to have a problem with a portion of your base.\nIf you pick somebody who isn't a person of colour, at the same time, you're going to have a problem with another portion of your base. And you're going to have a lot of other contenders out there, including some very attractive ones. Pete Buttigieg, a judge who ran the last time, has been a star for Democrats, appearing on Fox, basically flaying the opposition, there. And he's done quite well as the transportation secretary.\nYou have Cory Booker, who ran the last time, who's an attractive person. I would say if Catherine Cortez Masto somehow pulls out this victory in Nevada, along with the fact that you have a Hispanic governor in New Mexico who's quite attractive, who just won re-election again, there are going to be a lot of potential contenders but you're going to have a bitter internal contest, which is not anything that you want either.\nSo both parties have succession issues, here, with Trump on the ropes, with Biden in his 80s. I would be surprised, though, if Biden took himself out of the running before late next year at the latest-- at the earliest.\nEDWARD LUCE: That's interesting. Rana, let me just pick up something that Norm just said about Kamala Harris's weakness and what that might portend, in terms of the identity dimension, to a new Democratic nomination contest. That is, of course, the Achilles heel of the Democratic Party as well as its strength.\nRANA FOROOHAR: Right, right.\nEDWARD LUCE: What do you feel about that?\nRANA FOROOHAR: Well, it's interesting because Kamala gets right at both the identity issues and the failure of Democrats to really hold working people. Kamala really identifies much more with the middle of the road, corporatist wing of the party. And that's where she came up. And she took some flack in the beginning for that.\nI was hopeful that she would be a stronger candidate. I don't think she is. I would go with Norm and say that I think Biden should run. I think that he is absolutely the guy that still, even as he presents today-- and barring, as you say, any other kind of big, health issue-- that can win right now against, I think, either Trump or DeSantis.\nBut I would love to see him do it with a different veep. I would actually go with Pete Buttigieg because I think that he hits some of the diversity issues, actually. He's a he's a married, gay man.\nHe's a veteran. He hits to a lot of fields. He's a good messenger but he's also really strong on policy. I think nobody wants to see Biden going into this next election without a really safe pair of hands that represents something meaningful about the Democratic transition to a younger generation of politicians.\nEDWARD LUCE: James, do you do you share that? It seems like both Norm and Rana think that he should run and will run. Now I know as a reporter, you're more cautious about answering should questions. But can you give your take?\nJAMES POLITI: I think the Pennsylvania results was very important for Biden. I think that he campaigned there. He's from there. His wife Jill, is from there. He said it's close to his heart. It's the place that you went like 20 times over the past three months.\nAnd to see Fetterman, who was kind of in a bit of trouble the last few weeks, actually win pretty comfortably, I think will be a huge boost to Biden as he looks at 2024. And I felt like it was reflected in the way he talked about it yesterday, saying watch me, I'm going to go for it. And he said he was going to talk about it with Jill between Thanksgiving and Christmas, once they had a little bit of downtime.\nAnd so it looks like he's definitely feeling emboldened. On the other hand, it's also true that the exit polls showed that 66%, or more than 2/3 of Americans, think that he should not run and don't want him to run. And so I think that he has left a bit of an opening to make a decision the other way around.\nAnd he'll have to consider the fact that he is still quite unpopular and that it could be a bit of an uphill struggle. And if he decides to run he might he's going to have to face a lot of criticism in 2023 and beyond that maybe he's actually not up for it. And his legacy might end up losing to Trump or losing to DeSantis at the end of the day, which could be quite bruising because for now, he's the one who beat Trump and did better than expected in the midterms.\nEDWARD LUCE: I give you a first prize for understatement.\n[LAUGHTER]\nRANA FOROOHAR: Can we just state one thing about the Pennsylvania election, too? I found it so heartening that you cannot show up and be a total carpetbagger, like Mehmet Oz, and win. And it also speaks to the fact that even someone like Vance, that had Trump support, closer than you might have thought.\nSo I like the fact that voters are tuning in a little bit to authenticity. Here you've got the celebrity doctor that's campaigning against a guy that had a stroke mid campaign. And it was looking pretty dicey, probably because of Biden's support, but also, I think, because the voters just saw through someone like Mehmet Oz. They made the right decision.\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nEDWARD LUCE: --good point. A lot of people have been remarking, and I think correctly, in the last few days, that quality of candidates matters and the human connection matters. And whilst a lot of people were focusing on Fetterman's stroke and his difficulties with communicating, actually, the fact that he got back up, went back out there, and showed he had fight, tenacity, and therefore deserving of empathy, I think might have been underestimated.\nBut Norm, the thought did occur to me, in the last day or two, that the break-in and assault on Paul Pelosi, and Nancy Pelosi's husband, the speaker's husband, in the last few days-- in the closing days of the campaign-- and the fact that many Republicans, starting with Trump, expressed no sympathy for her, in fact, used to use that event as a way of further dissing Pelosi, that might be an underappreciated factor.\nWe all, of course, we're unusual. We pay attention to politics 365 days a year. But we're a rare breed. We're like stamp collectors. Most people don't pay that much attention to politics until the closing stretches of a campaign. And this happened in the closing stretch. Are we underestimating the backlash against how Paul Pelosi's assault was depicted?\nJAMES POLITI: I think you're exactly right, Ed. It's a jolt to Americans, with the fear and the threat of violence emerging through our political process and the tribalism that we have is enhancing that. And I'm concerned, as so many are. And that may have had a significant impact out there and the way in which Republicans have responded to it, the encouragement of violence, which is a problem that we have continuing ahead.\nAnd frankly, it's reinforced, for me, the reality that the Republican Party is no longer a traditional political party. It's a cult. And if he had given sympathy to Paul Pelosi or said, we need to rally behind Nancy Pelosi, as a Republican, you're going to face attacks. So we're in a very different place.\nBefore we go, Ed, I'd like to make two more points. We were talking about Pennsylvania. Viewers, listeners, should keep their eyes on Josh Shapiro, who won overwhelmingly as the governor of Pennsylvania, who actually is another one of those young, up-and-coming people. He's not going to be a presidential candidate in two years. But there's some talent on the bench there as people move forward.\nAnd then we haven't talked enough about the other implications of a even narrow Republican majority in the House, including, I think, what will be of interest to readers, foreign policy. We're going to have Republicans in the House who are going to try to interfere as much as they can with Biden's foreign policy.\nThey're going to use the Afghanistan hearings to try and tie down Tony Blinken and others in the State Department. They're going to use the power of the purse to cut back on diplomacy, not just aid to Ukraine. We're probably going to see Republicans in Congress go overseas and try to undermine Biden's ties to our alliances. There are obviously, as you said, a bunch of Putinistas there.\nSo there are headaches that emerge, even with an election that was far better than expected for Democrats. And they're going to have to do some very heavy lifting, here, to make sure that they can keep everybody on track and moving forward with the policies that they want, when they're going to be undermined, to some degree, from within.\nEDWARD LUCE: We have got four minutes left. So I'm going to ask each of you to give a one-minute answer to the following question. And Norm, thank you for pointing out-- FTV does. We're a global newspaper. And this isn't just an American event. This has a great implications for everyone else.\nSo each of you, starting with James, what should America's allies and partners take from this election? What do you think is significant for them?\nJAMES POLITI: I think what's significant is that there is a backlash to Trumpism. So the 2024 election will not necessarily yield a return to Trump. There's a big, red ocean out there. But there's also a very big blue ocean out there.\nAnd I think that that's very important to keep in mind. And American democracy is unsettled but it's continuing to churn and produce outcomes that maybe give some hope that the decline isn't a permanent feature.\nEDWARD LUCE: Rana.\nRANA FOROOHAR: That's a great question. I think that allies, overseas readers, listeners, sometimes don't understand deeply enough that there is rhetoric that has to be put forward in the US at this moment. Some of the America-First stuff, even the Buy-America stuff, from the Biden administration, which is much fuzzier around the edges than you might imagine-- it's basically Buy America and 60 allies-- that the rhetoric is important for Democrats who have lost working people.\nAnd if you don't want to see Trump in office, you have to be a little more patient with some of the rhetoric and look at the real policies underneath it. And I'm hopeful, I'm hopeful, that this is a moment, particularly with the US and Europe that there could be a little more coming together. I would love to see Macron, on his upcoming state visit in December, really get together with Biden. Let's do some horse trading.\nLet's get on the same page with climate. Let's look at the low-hanging fruit. Let's quit bashing the US for EV subsidies-- Hello, Germany, plenty of auto subsidies there, plenty of agricultural subsidies in Europe-- let's get real about politics and policy and get on the same page.\nEDWARD LUCE: Norm, the last word to you.\nNORM ORNSTEIN: So we can breathe a sigh of relief, momentarily, that the march towards the Orbanization of America has been halted for now. But we also-- for those all around the world, if Trump is fading, Trumpism is not. And Trumpism includes America first, a disdain for alliances.\nThe lure of dictators is a very strong with them. We have to guard against that as best we can. But everybody should prepare for the possibility of a future where America's role in the world is curtailed. The Reagan wing of the Republican Party is not consequential anymore.\nAnd that means that our allies have to do more, anticipating the possibility that we may not have the same kind of strong, American leadership that the world, I believe, needed and has come to rely on.\nEDWARD LUCE: Well, thank you. I saw one made a comment-- and I apologise for not getting through so many of them-- but one, saying, we wish this could have gone on for two or three hours, this fascinating discussion. I agree with that.\nThank you to all four of you, James, Rana, Norm, and his dog, Henry, who deserves a shout out.\nRANA FOROOHAR (LAUGHING): Henry.\nEDWARD LUCE: Thank you, all of you. That was a really, really substantive, useful discussion, which I greatly enjoyed.\nRANA FOROOHAR: Thanks Ed.\nNORM ORNSTEIN: Thank you, Ed.\nJAMES POLITI: Thanks Ed.\nScoreboard14 min\nHow India can revolutionise women's cricket | FT Scoreboard\nA successful league would bring money and prestige to the women's game around the world\nMarkets26 min\nFractured markets: the big threats to the financial system\nCracks form in global markets as central bankers get tough\nFT Financial Literacy and Inclusion Campaign32 min\nUS bank branch closures widen social inequality | FT Film\nThere are over 1,600 'banking deserts' in the US, with a lack of financial services hitting African-Americans hardest.

We talk about the3 essential qualities of a great leader, the importance of clarity, alignment, and movement as you lead your community bank.\nCheck out Lead In 30 here: http://leadin30.com/\nIntro: Helping community bankers grow themselves, their team, and their profits. This is the Community Bank Podcast.\nCaleb Stevens: Well, Hey everybody. And welcome back to the community bank podcast I’m Caleb Stevens. And today I am speaking with Russ Hill, the co-founder of Lone Rock Consulting. They work with some of the biggest companies in the country, and Russ is a leadership expert. This is a great discussion on how to engage your team, how to cast vision, how to create clarity, and also how to make sure that your vision gets throughout the entire organization. It’s one thing for the CEO to talk about the vision or to have the vision on the website, but it’s another to have every major leader within the organization, living it out and sharing it with their team and making sure that it sticks throughout the whole company. And so hope you enjoy this discussion with Mr. Russ Hill.\nWell, Russ, thanks for hopping on the podcast today, it’s great to be talking with you. I followed you for a couple of years and it’s great to finally put a face with the name. So how are things out in Phoenix?\nRuss Hill: Hot. At the time we’re recording this, this isn’t the place you want to be in January, February is the time to be in Phoenix, but things are going well at Caleb it’s great to meet you and I appreciate the opportunity to share some of the things that we’ve learned that I’ve learned working in this space over the years.\nCaleb Stevens: Give us a quick snapshot of your career. How did you get into the leadership consulting space? What do you do at Lone Rock Consulting? Give us the quick 30,000-foot flyover.\nRuss Hill: Yes. It’s not the most exciting story and it’s not that predictable, but I never viewed myself. I don’t think you, maybe some people grow up. No, I’m going to work as a consultant with senior executive teams of corporations I’m a teacher about leadership. I certainly didn’t grow up thinking that I wanted to be in the media I wanted to be a TV reporter, I wanted to travel the world and cover news events and so that’s what I did. That’s what I did for almost 20 years of my career and on the air in different, primarily radio stations and news and sports did that for a lot of years. And then worked my way into management, and started overseeing properties that our media company was acquiring. And that’s when I got interested in leadership because the teams I was leading did not like me and I thought they did. But then our company, the national broadcast company I was working for at the time started to do these things called employee engagement surveys. And the scores came back, I can laugh about it now, Caleb, but it was painful at the time. I have the distinct honor of being in the company that I worked for and have been rated the lowest leader in the company. In other words, the most toxic culture, the leader whose team disliked them the most man, that’s painful when you get that. And I was in my early twenties at the time and I had a choice to make at that time either lose my job because my team would all quit or change and so that’s when I became obsessed with culture.\nThat’s when I became obsessed with how you lead in a way that not only delivers results but that’s what you’re paid to deliver as a leader. But how do I do it in a way where my people like working for me, they like what we’re doing they feel a sense of purpose? We retain our best talent. How do I do that? It was a painful process and I read every book possible, I paid a lot of money out of my pocket to be developed I had leaders that mentored me and sent me to different things from universities to Gallup, to this, to that. And then long story short after a long time in the media career and no longer being the lowest rated leader growing and improving as a leader, I left the media world and went to join a consulting firm that had recruited me that specialized in the space of culture management.\nCaleb Stevens: So, making an assumption here, but I would guess, before you saying that survey, I’m guessing you’d probably read a leadership book or two, in the past, and then it sounds like it’s probably one thing maybe to know about leadership from a head knowledge perspective, but then to live it and to be accountable to it and to see real results in the workplace. Did you see a disconnect there? Had you read leadership books before and now what sort of a wake-up call? What was that like?\nRuss Hill: Yes, I had. And I wanted to be a good leader and so whether it was listening to at the time audiobooks write CDs at the time, now you can download them on audible or whatever, but or going to the Barnes and Noble back in the day and buying a book, I was doing that I was a student of leadership. So, that was part of my leadership development but I think the more pronounced or the part that affected me more was watching other leaders, and in my experience now working with leaders and as an executive coach and working as a consultant with leadership teams, what I’ve learned over the years is other leaders do exactly what I did, which is what are the traits in the leaders I hate that I don’t want to be around. That I just despise working for, or that man, there just don’t seem like pleasant people, or maybe they’re pleasant, but they just create an environment to where it, it doesn’t feel like we’re accomplishing things or my ideas don’t feel heard, or we’re not going anywhere as an organization. So, you look at those leaders and you go, okay, don’t do that, don’t be that and then you look at the leaders like, man, that person is amazing and what are they doing? And how do I become more like them? I think that’s probably where most of us have learned or what we’ve studied. And a lot of its unconscious we don’t even realize we’re doing it, but a lot of our leadership development in what I’ve seen is in watching and then modeling or repeating or cloning the behavior of other leaders.\nCaleb Stevens: Well, I can hear the broadcasting voice now that we’re talking. Any lessons from a communication standpoint that broadcasting and media taught you?\nRuss Hill: Yes, ton. I feel like I’m so blessed. I feel like there was this journey that I couldn’t see, yet my life was needing to go where it was the combination of these two worlds. And yes, if you think about it, most effective leaders, most good leaders, not all of them, but most of them are good communicators. And so I studied communications in college, not only because it was the easiest degree I could find that required the least amount of time in a classroom, but because I wanted to go into the media business. And so, effective leaders communicate and a lot of that starts with, and this is tied to Caleb. It’s tied to culture too, which we’ll get into, but a lot of it is effectively describing the vision, the destination you think about like Google maps. I would pay so much money if they charged me for that app on my phone. It’s so valuable to me, especially somebody who travels for a large part of what I do with clients and so you drop into a city and you just type in the destination, but you think about that app without the destination entered in, it’s kind of cool to look at the roads around you and whatever else, but it’s not that valuable. That app becomes valuable after you type in the destination and then it’s helping you. Hey, look out for this, that route’s closed. Don’t go there. You need to know this area’s under construction. This is the speed, this is where you’re likely to get there. Just like an effective communicator as a leader, we’re able to get up in a virtual meeting in an email in an in-person meeting and describe effectively this is not the only part of communications that has ties to the leadership, but it’s one part and it directly affects your culture.\nRuss Hill: There’s no question about it, which is, can I effectively describe the destination? I’m trying to take my team too because you think about the word leader. It implies we don’t think about this a lot, but I’m leading you, I’m leading our team somewhere. And so if I were to ask your team, where is Russ? Where is Caleb leading you? How would they answer that? Do they know what the destination is? What success have we defined success in a way? Or is it just being busy and kind of doing my job? And that’s not enough you think about the organizations that have a great culture and that are, you think about super effective leaders, they have a vision they’re taking the team somewhere.\nCaleb Stevens: Yes. Well, to hire you all, I would think that requires on your client’s part, a great deal of self-awareness to even know, hey, we need to invest and improve our leadership. And yet it seems like so many folks who are not the best leaders that’s one of the main issues is they don’t have the self-awareness to even know, Hey, we need to hire a guy like Russ, how do you sort of, think that through, because I would think you see a lot of opportunities to help leaders, but yet if they don’t have the self-awareness to know, we need to invest in ourselves, they’re never going to give you a call.\nRuss Hill: Yes. It’s a great point and our business or our interaction with leaders is driven a lot by two different categories. It is the self-aware leader and it’s the leader who may be or, isn’t thinking about how I need to change to be more effective. We never get a call or we hardly ever get a call from somebody saying, help me be a better leader. We usually don’t get that call. What we get is a direct message on LinkedIn that says we need help with our results. And so either we’re not retaining the people that we want to retain, or we’re in this incredibly competitive environment and how do we attract better talent or our people aren’t engaged. I was on the phone with a Fortune 10 company that’s a client of our healthcare company. And they got their most recent poll survey from employees. They went, man, we went down again, and we’ve been going down every year since this pandemic started a few years ago.\nAnd so, that that’s driving their need to get some help so it’s driven usually by results, and sometimes it’s a leader calling saying, or direct messaging us and saying, Hey, can you help us with this? And by the way, it’s not always a burning platform like Amazon’s a client of ours and Amazon didn’t have any problem with it, they’re people that hate Amazon, but most of us have boxes from them that are piling up on the front porch. And so what caused them to want to dig into this topic was we want to grow even faster and they have this hunger to be absolutely the best at every single thing that they do. So you have that group Caleb, and then you have another group that typically drives our interaction and maybe it’s the board. I could tell you plenty of stories where it’s a board of directors that goes, yes, our team needs help. Or it’s an executive saying, not calling for themselves, but saying, we’ve got this business unit or these locations or this team, can you help us with them?\nCaleb Stevens: Yes, well, I saw Gallup’s recent state of the workforce survey from, I think it was 2021 and it was something like 34% of US workers are engaged around 49 or 50% are disengaged, and then about 15 or so are actively disengaged. And I’ve been sort of thinking through, what’s the driver here? Is it leadership? Is it culture? Is it not connecting the vision of the company to the everyday experiences of the team members? I think that’s sort of putting your thumb on kind of hits on that. What’s your take on those engagement surveys? What’s sort of the root cause? Is it leadership from the top?\nRuss Hill: Yes. And it’s interesting because the year of that data, the year that you cite doesn’t matter, it’s the same in 2022, 2021, 2020, 2015, and 2010, there has been no movement. You can Google this, and do the research. We wrote the book, The Great Resignation a year and a half or so ago. And so we hired this team of data scientists to dig in and look at all the research because we had our theories based on working. We feel like we work in a leadership lab with, leaders of all these different organizations from manufacturing to financial, the world that you all live in retail, to restaurants, to healthcare, to whatever it might be. So we feel like, we had some real theories on what was causing all the movement in the workforce. And then we started looking at the data and one of the things that data uncovered was there’s been no movement in employee engagement in over 20 years. None. But there has been a change in the outcome or the effect of that. So, if you think about five years ago, if I’m disengaged, back to those numbers, you just said. If I’m disengaged from working at a bank or a Credit Union, and I’m not happy or I’m not satisfied. What do I do? Typically what I do is I keep showing up and I start poisoning the people around me. We call it the excuse trap. I’m blaming everyone and everything for why I’m dissatisfied. It’s that policy, it’s that leader it’s that other team it’s whatever it is that I’m justified in, in my frustration at work.\nRuss Hill: And a lot of it by the way is justifiable, but then you just go to this negative, vicious, poisonous place and I’m obsessed with everything I can’t control. Everything bad about this job, this company, this location, this branch, whatever it has nothing to do with me and everything to do with everyone else, so you externalize it. So five years ago, if I’m in that situation, I become poisonous and I do that. Now after the pandemic and the current environment that we work in. And by the way, the data suggests that it’s not guessing what the pandemic didn’t start this change it just accelerated it. And the fact that we’re hopefully continuing to come out of the pandemic, it’s not going to change it either that’s our theory. And we think we’re being proven right by the data we’ll see in the next, 6, 12, 18, and 36 months. But now what happens? I come into the branch I come into work, I’m frustrated I still poison everybody, and then I just don’t show up and I don’t stay, I leave because I have so many different options. So what’s driving your question? What’s driving that disengagement?\nSo much of it is leadership it’s all tied to leadership and yet you have leaders that go. “No, it’s the market. It’s the customer it’s the whatever, it’s all these different things. No, we just have to be honest. It’s just like me when I got those scores, two decades, three decades ago of Russ, you suck as a leader, your team doesn’t like you, they’re not engaged that’s what my team was not engaged. And what changed the level of engagement on that team Caleb was me as I started to change as a leader, there were other things, but once I took ownership of that and went, okay, what’s the culture I’m creating? What are the beliefs that my team holds? What experiences am I creating? What’s the mindset? What’s the narrative on this team? What are the stories that are being told once I started taking ownership of that and defining it, then I could shift it?\nCaleb Stevens: Well, I think that’s a good segue into one of the things that you preach is that there are two essential qualities of leadership. And of course, there’s been hundreds of books written on the subject, thousands of books, probably you could define in several ways you could come up with 30 great qualities of a leader, but there’s two that I’ve seen that you preach, that you hammer home. Would you mind kind of unpacking those for us?\nRuss Hill: Yes. And in fact, I’m going to expand it to three. So you’ve probably seen me talk about two, which means I need to do a better job of talking about all three. And the ones that we focus on the most with leaders and you’re right there’s a lot of different content that you can go into. For instance, you might have seen me posting on social media about transactional versus transformational leaders might be what you’re referring to. And so a transactional leader as I come in and my job is just too kind of maintain, just to run the place. My job is just to, kind of make sure, and don’t screw it up. Right. And then a transformational leader, somebody that comes in and says, okay, where are we headed? What’s the potential here? What’s possible back to my Google maps analogy, where could we be in two or three years?\nAnd they’re looking for movement and by the way, every employee wants to work for a transformational leader. Well, I’m going to say, not every employee, there are a few that are very happy not having any movement or growth, but there is this human need in most of us, a few people have suppressed it, but there’s a human need to grow, to create, to become something better than ourselves. And so we want to work for leaders that do that. So, that’s one distinction we make as we work with leaders transactional versus transformational and or transformative leaders. The other thing that I would talk about is just, that when it comes to culture, what great leaders do is focus on three areas and we call it the third leader.\nRuss Hill: And, let me walk you through this just real quickly, it’ll take me a minute or two. So the first leader, so I’m just going to define different leadership profiles. This is helpful in our experience because often we aren’t putting the mirror on ourselves and thinking about, okay, well, what kind of leader am I? I might think about what kind of leader I am, but I’m defining it by 50 million things let’s narrow it down. So, the first leader is somebody who’s got no vision, they haven’t defined anything. It’s not that their team’s not doing anything in fact, their team feels super busy. Tons are going on, but they feel like they’re on a treadmill, sweaty, exhausted, just they’re busy all day long, but we’re not going anywhere. We can’t point to any progress we’ve made as an organization or a team over the last, six, 12, or 36 months, whatever it might be.\nSo there’s no vision, the first leader, loves discussion, they hesitate to make decisions so they love meetings. There’s just endless discussion you log into their meetings, you walk into their meetings, just tons of dialogue and it’s because the first leader leans into consensus. So, what they care about more than anything else is I don’t want to create conflict that doesn’t want to make decisions because I just want consensus and there are all kinds of costs that an organization pays because of that. The second leader views themselves as an upgrade, they’re an evolution of the first leader, and they used to be the first leader now they’re not. And the second leader, they’ve got a vision the problem is it reads like a Broadway playbill they’re 150 priorities, 20 pages long and so everything’s a priority.\nSo, they think they’ve created a vision, but in fact, it’s way too complicated, nobody knows what to do with it. The second leader micromanages they’ve had your job and they can’t wait to tell you how to do it more effectively. And so they pride themselves on making decisions unlike the first leader, the second leader making decisions on a moment’s notice, they don’t have anybody coming along with them or taking ownership of it because they had no involvement in that decision. So, the second leader doesn’t seek to create conflict, but, by nature of the way they lead, they create tons of conflict, they create silos, okay. The third leader is what we advocate going into and the third leader does these three things, these are the three categories I was talking about.\nThe third leader creates clarity in its three to four key results, these are the most important things for our financial institution to deliver this year. And it might be a revenue number it might a profit number, it might be several new clients might be employee engagement whatever it is. These are the three things it’s not more than three or four because people can’t remember more than three or four. We want them top of mind and so, the third leader creates clarity. The second thing that they do is build alignment they understand that there’s a fundamental difference between my team being aware of things and that that’s what most leaders do they make their team aware of it. Here’s the new policy, here’s the plan for the next year, and here’s the new project. They create awareness and then wonder why they don’t have alignment. And alignment happens out loud it’s messy and so, the third leader not only creates clarity, but they build alignment around their vision the team’s not just aware of it. They are aligned to it and alignment’s different than an agreement by the way. And then the third thing that the third leader does is generate movement and this is where culture management comes in they define the mindset of the team.\nSo, whether you look at Chick-fil-A you look at Amazon, you look at Apple, just go down the list of companies that you think of as culture, as a competitive advantage, they have defined the culture they’re looking for. Well, how do you define culture? It’s not a bunch of old static, stale values that are sitting on a frame, somewhere gathering dust. It’s a living, breathing timely set of statements that can be three or four, and it shouldn’t be more than that. That defines how we need to be thinking and acting. So for instance, Amazon, I’ll hesitate it so I give you a chance to work it out Caleb, but you can tell I’m passionate about this, can’t you? So like Amazon, they call them leadership principles is biased for action we are hiring people who are this way. They are biased to take action they’re not biased toward discussion. They’re not biased for analysis. They’re biased toward action. You can Google Amazon biased for action you’ll see it’s one of their leadership principles. There’s a large defense contractor we worked with we’ve consulted their senior team for a lot of years. They just rewrote their set of culture, principles, whatever you want to call them leadership principles.\nAnd one of them is accelerating change. They’re way too stuck in the status quo, they need more people innovating, speaking up challenging the way we’ve always done it. If they’re going to compete for talent and clients and so accelerate change defines the narrative that they’re looking for. In other organizations, it’s the customer first, the patient first, or it’s one team. So you look at if I’m the leader of a financial institution, whether it’s just one location or a bunch of them, I’m looking at what’s the narrative. How do I want people to describe how we think and act here? Do we accelerate change? Are we one team? Customer-first, biased fraction. What are those few statements that define the way we need people to think and act? And you define the culture and you start managing it.\nCaleb Stevens: So clarity, alignment, and movements. So let’s say you’re working with a large company and let’s say the executive team says, yes, Russ, I get it, we’re all about that. There’s clarity on the executive team there’s alignment. They’re committed to making change happen. But, my gosh, when you get 5, 6, or 7 layers down into the organization, how do you cast vision and create clarity in such a way that it spreads in scales to the whole organization? I heard you say one thing, the bias fraction, that’s a short, frequently repeated sticky, portable phrase that can probably be disseminated throughout the whole company. But how do leaders who are trying to create movement and clarity and alignment with 5, 6,000 folks? How do they do that effectively?\nRuss Hill: Okay. So it’s a great question. And there’s a lot to that, but I’ll give you the 30,000-foot kind of, a thumbnail version of this. So the first thing is if I were to call all of your direct reports, whatever financial institution, whatever team you’re leading. So, I’m going to call your direct reports we’re going to do a quick zoom meeting I’m going to ask them what the three things that define success are. Would they all answer the same way? And in our experience of asking that question for over 15 years, in all kinds of industries, in all kinds of locations around the world, it is over 95% of the teams we interview do not answer the same. They don’t have clarity, you think they do? Yes, we’re clear. But you’ve shown them the plan for the year it’s got 50 million things in it and, or they’re aware of it, but they’re not aligned to it. So, they know you’re saying this is important, but they’re overworking on that and so how do you get it throughout the organization? You start with, you have to drill in on the leadership team with this. Do we have clarity? So, what are the three most important things? And we would tell you, and again, we teach all this in this thing called Leadin 30. People can find out about it at leadin30.com. It’s like, think about it like a 30-day fitness challenge, but it’s a 30-day leadership challenge anybody can sign up for it we offer it for free. We just require that people bring two leaders, other leaders from their company with them because then it gets traction and impact and that helps our organization.\nSo, leadin30.com and we start week one is all about clarity, we call them RPM Key results, repeatable, purposeful, measurable. Are they repeatable, a large pharmaceutical company we consult it’s 5, 1, 85 those are their key results? Everybody in the whole organization, tens of thousands of people knows 5, 1, 85 and those numbers 5 1 85 represent three different metrics that are incredibly important. The general motor is a client of our three zeros. If you look up Google GM, we could talk about this I can mention their name because it’s public. But general motors, six years ago, we were in the room when they wrote the three zeros that are the vision for general motors. How do you get, how do you get tens of thousands of people aligned? You start with clarity at the top. So we’re going to discuss what is clarity, what are RPM repeatable, purposeful, measurable, and key results we’re going to discuss and then we’re going to look for alignment. How aligned are we as a team?\nAnd alignment means, I feel heard I feel involved doesn’t mean I have to agree with you, but I feel like I had a chance to weigh in before you decided on anything. And teams don’t make decisions, leaders make decisions, but teams inform leaders to make the best decision. So, many organizations have that backward they think teams make decisions. No, your job as a leader of that leadership team is not to get them to help you make a decision, they help you make the decision, but you make the decision or you delegate one of the decisions to them and they’re the decision maker. So you create alignment there and then you start to define at the executive level, Caleb, how do we need people thinking and acting? Then you go, we just did this with a large manufacturing company, 425 directors VPS along with the ELT, they have 35,000 people underneath them. They’re at multiple warehouses around the US and the world. And so, we have them in leadin30 virtual set of meetings, 30 days long, one meeting a week. And so 425 top leaders going in to create clarity, alignment movement at that level because if we’ve spent months student the leadership team, the ELT level.\nNow they’re rolling it out and they’re recruiting into the conversation, these 425 directors and VPs and by the way, we just wrapped up that session with them last Friday, at the time we’re recording this and they came out of it going, my gosh, the directors are going. I’ve never had access to the ELT like that. Never been able to interact, they didn’t say it this way, but you could tell, I don’t feel like my voice was heard the way it has been the last four weeks. So now you’re moving down the org chart. Guess what the next step is the next layer. So, that’s an extreme example of a very large organization, but you take a company of 300 or a company of 3000 and it’s the same principle.\nCaleb Stevens: Yes. And it reminds me of the phrase people support our world that they help create they may not make the final decision, but if they feel like their voice is heard and they have some level of input that creates buy-in long term. And I would guess too, when you talk about transactional versus a transformational leader, you need transformational leaders at the middle management level to bring the vision to life across the whole company because it’s just status quo if it’s transformational at the top, but status quo in the middle, how much change are you going to make.\nRuss Hill: A hundred percent? And the phrase that we so often hear our clients referred to, especially our fortune 100 companies that we work with, the frozen middle, you might have heard that those leaders in the middle, we call it the clay layer, the roots go down from the ELT end of the next level. And then they kind of hit this clay and we can’t get the roots to go deeper in the organization. And how do we get that to change? Well, a lot of it’s recruiting them into the conversation and there are a lot of things that sucked were horrible about this pandemic, but one of the benefits of it is the change in the way we work in multiple ways where we can do this virtually you don’t have to fly everybody in. For me we just did it with this manufacturing company got 450 liters nobody got on a plane, and nobody came off the factory floor. All they did was log into a virtual meeting one hour a week and then went and consumed some content in their own time in between the meetings and we’re having these kinds of conversations. So, we can work our way through the organization and impact the culture and get buy-in at a lower level of the organization. More efficiently, more effectively than we ever, leaders, 10 years ago, would’ve been dying to have the ability to reach deeper in the organization the way we can now with the tools we have virtually.\nCaleb Stevens: That’s a good segue into something I wanted to ask you about COVID. How have you seen the best leaders navigate COVID because you talk about clarity? I mean, my goodness, how hard has it been for leaders to offer clarity to their team over the past three years? And what I’ve sort of landed on is you can’t offer everybody certainty, but you can’t offer them the clarity that you do have. How have you seen the best leaders navigate? I can’t offer certainty, but I can’t offer the clarity that I do have, but even that takes intention.\nRuss Hill: Yes. And what you’re speaking to is transparency and so nobody likes driving and fog. When we get behind the wheel, what we want is visibility. Please show me the road ahead. Because if I’ve got fog or I’ve got a limited field of vision, I’ve got to dramatically reduce the speed and I’m tense and I’ve got all these concerns about the danger because whenever I join an organization or I log into a meeting for the first time, the first human behavior I’m most concerned about is threat detection. Is it safe for me to be here? Am I in the right place? Am I looking stupid? Can I speak up? How’s that going to go? And so, I want visibility, I want to feel safe I want comfort. As sometimes as a leader, we can’t provide that. And the example you’re using Caleb of you think about those first few weeks or months after the pandemic began, who the crud had clarity, right? None of us did. It’s a great point and some things happen in our companies as senior leader leaves all of a sudden. We got a text yesterday from an executive we thought was in line to be CEO eventually of a Fortune 50 company.\nAnd all of a sudden the executive team was shocked yesterday when he announced his departure, I’m leaving, whoa, what we thought you were a lifetime person here. And so that creates uncertainty so it’s not just a pandemic or a global event there are things in our industry. Think about real estate right now, how much certainty is there in the real estate market? Like very little. And so when the field of vision is reduced, what I do as a leader is two things. I increase my visibility and I increase my transparency. In other words, my team wants to see me, they want visibility of me because they’re wondering what I’m thinking. Am I okay? Where’s the leadership team at? And so I increased my visibility and transparency to sound like this team. We know you’re concerned about this we know that you aren’t sure about this, whatever it is, you’re validating the emotion you know they’re feeling. You’re not pretending, there is nothing to see here, nothing’s wrong with the market, or just put your head down and go execute and everything’s going to be alright. I was talking to somebody that’s a developer and, and builds a bunch of homes in the west the other day.\nAnd he was talking about his sales team and he’s a friend, a great person, but this is a terrible leadership tactic. And he was talking about, yes, we met with our sales team I just told him again, real estate. He’s like, just put your head down like, so it’s never been this good, it’s awesome. And I’m thinking, that’s not what your team wants to hear. What they want to hear is man, things have changed it’s not as good as it was three weeks ago, three months ago. And they want you to hear, that we’re not sure where this is headed, but here’s what we do know, and here’s what we are working on. So, whatever level of transparency I can offer and then visibility so they know that they’re seeing me because a lot of leaders when something hits pandemic or a downward spiral or a downward turn in the market, whatever it is, they tend to go into hiding. And it’s not intentional necessarily they’re super busy and they don’t have certainty, but it just causes that organization like a driver and fog to slow down or even completely stop moving.\nCaleb Stevens: Yes. That’s good. Well, as we wrap up here, I’d love to get your take on culture and we talked a little bit about it earlier in the show, you know we’re bankers, Russ. So, we tend to think of culture as, the soft stuff, how do you quantify culture? Is that just the bean bags in the break room and PTO we’re all kind to each other and it’s a fuzzy place to work? Culture, can you put a number on that? We care about the P&L and balance sheet. How do you define culture? Because when you say results, I think that gets our attention as bankers well man, I want to get results. So where’s the connection there?\nRuss Hill: Right. That’s where the conversation about culture has to start and you’re right Caleb people think of it, there is a good number that you mentioned that where culture and people are like, I need to hit the pause button on the podcast now we’re getting into the soft stuff. No, think at Chick-fil-A they’re going, yes, cultures the soft stuff. We’ll get to it when we can get to it. You think at Southwest airlines are going yes, culture, if you guys have time to deal with culture, you might dig into it. No, it’s their competitive advantage it’s everything to them. And so, when you think about culture, the first place that you start is with the results. I’ve got two levers to pull as a leader to affect the results. One is a strategy and by the way, one of these without the other is not very valuable. So I’ve got a strategy, I got to build the business plan I got to come up with, what are we going to do? What’s the plan for the next 12, 24, or 36 months? Where are we headed? So that strategy, the other one is culture. How do I need our people to think and act? I’ll give you an example, just too kind of illustrate this. So the gym that I go to is just a few miles from my house been going there, and our family’s been going for years.\nSo you used to go and walk in and, and your check-in, you scan your phone or your gym membership card. If you go into the gym and you scan that and you go in and you do whatever you’re going to do, get on a machine and do some cardio, or you’re doing some strength training, you’re going to go, lifts some weights, whatever it is. So you walk in and there’s nothing notable about our gym it’s just like, whatever okay, nothing meaningful about it. Then one day I’m walking in and there’s somebody at the counter and they’re like, “Hey, how’s it going? Welcome in.” Like super friendly the moment I open the door and they’re at the desk right there at the front entrance. And I’m thinking, that’s nice, they hired somebody super friendly. Then I scan my phone and they’re like, “Hey Russ. How is it? How’s your day going? What are you doing today? What are you working on?” I said, “Well, I’m here, I’m going to do some strength training, chest day, whatever it is. Like, “Okay, great workout. If you need anything, let us know”. So as I’m going to the bench, what am I thinking Caleb about that employee?\nCaleb Stevens: You’re thinking, huh? Where did he come from?\nRuss Hill: Right. They hired someone super friendly or he’s in a good mood, they promoted somebody, and he’s super excited about his job. So then it happens the next day and it’s somebody else. Then it happens the next day and it’s somebody else then on my way out, they’re “Hey, have a great afternoon. Thanks so much for coming in. How was your workout?” So something shifted what happened in that location by the way and it’s been like two and a half years since that happened. Same experience and in a gym membership, if you know anything about that industry, it’s like restaurants and retail, massive turnover. The same people aren’t working at the gym, 50% turnover, in however many months. And so the people have changed yet the culture is staying the same. Why is that? Guess what I bet one of their metrics is. What do you think one of their key metrics Caleb at that gym is?\nCaleb Stevens: That’s a good point…\nRuss Hill: Tied to my experience. What do you think they’re measuring that’s affecting that?\nCaleb Stevens: Probably something related to customer engagement. I would think too or…\nRuss Hill: Yes, satisfaction.\nCaleb Stevens: Yes.\nRuss Hill: Yes. So, when you join our organization, you work at that gym. I don’t know this, I’m telling you this. This is my theory based on how I know this works inside organizations. But the gyms, not client, and this is a chain out in the Western US so they’re all over a bunch of states and it’s the same place I’ve gone into multiple locations when I travel same experience. So, what happens is they, you join the team and they say, Hey, by the way, here are the most important things. One of our most important metrics at this gym is member satisfaction. So to affect the culture I start with, what I define. So at Chick-fil-A, what’s one of the most important metrics, customer satisfaction, so McDonald’s tracking customer satisfaction I don’t think so. Maybe they are I don’t know, but have work to do, but Chick-fil-A that is it. Same thing you think united airlines is tracking customer satisfaction, not the way that Delta or Southwest is. And so, you start with the metric, Hey team, you’re joining the team, this is one of our most important that’s clarity, most important things. Then you need to help them get aligned to it back to my clarity, and alignment movements. So, alignment is, do you understand how you affect it? The way you affect it is in the drive-through, we need you to ask people their first name, and we need you to tell them, it’s my pleasure. At the gym when they walk through the door, we need you to be friendly you affect, your job is not to check people in. Your job is to deliver 90% customer satisfaction.\nRuss Hill: You see in the switch here Caleb?\nRuss Hill: So, your job is not just to help people with, get their withdrawals or deposits in the bank. Your job is customer satisfaction and here’s the metric how do you think you affect it? Because the most effective way to have that conversation is to ask them the new team member or the long-time team member, how do you affect it? “Well, I do this.” “Great.” And then I’m getting into movement, which is okay. So, how do we need people to think? Let’s define that when we hire them let’s interview them for that way of thinking. When we promote them let’s promote them based on the fact that they lean into that. So, that’s culture and in my experience, it’s not the soft side, it’s not optional, it is a competitive advantage. The reason most leaders are not most what the data shows is a lot of leaders will say culture is, a soft skill, and the reason they say that is they don’t know how to define it and they don’t know how to manage it. And so, what I’ve given you here is some high-level, how do you define it? And then we haven’t gotten into, but we talk about this in leading 30, then you have to start, well, how do I manage that on a day-to-day basis? How do I manage culture in my one-on-ones or our weekly meetings or those sorts of things, you have to continually manage it as well.\nCaleb Stevens: Yes. Well, that’s a great segue if folks want to find out more about what you offer for leaders. If the community bankers listening are saying, wow, Russ, I need more of this. Where do I find it? How can they engage with you leadin 30? What are all the resources you offer and how can they get in touch?\nRuss Hill: Yes. Leadin30.com is the best way we just had Utah in the state of Utah, the whole Utah bankers association sent a bunch of leaders from various financial institutions through, as I said, we don’t charge anything. And so if you go to leadin30.com, you’ll see that there is, I think the list price on its 497, $497 per participant now. But if you direct message me on LinkedIn and we’re making some changes to that sheet, we’ll get you in for free and we do it every six weeks, we kick off leadin 30, every six weeks. So, we had a credit union in the Seattle area that put 40 leaders through it. So, whether you go through it or not, doesn’t matter there are a lot of principles that you can see, you can see videos of leaders that have been through it. You can see everyone I’ve been mentioning Chick-fil-A DN Turner. Who’s a longtime C H R O head of human resources at Chick-fil-A.?\nCaleb Stevens: Yes, we had her on the show probably a year ago.\nRuss Hill: Did you? Yes. She’s awesome. So, DN Turners in there as well as Francis Fry, she’s a Harvard Business School Professor. She went on a sabbatical when Uber called and said they were desperate several years ago and said, can you help us turn around our culture? So we got interviews with a bunch of executives like that, that are in leadin 30, as well as our team so that’s the best way. And then LinkedIn, Caleb, just search Russ Hill and leadin 30. You’ll find me and I’d love to connect with anybody who wants to.\nCaleb Stevens: Well, I think we could go for another hour if you let me, but want to respect your time, Russ. Thanks for joining us. We’ll link to leading 30 in the show notes and we appreciate you being here.\nRuss Hill: Hey Caleb, you’re a great host man. I’ve been on a lot of podcasts I appreciate the questions, and I appreciate your efficiency and asking them and giving me a chance to kind of share what I’ve learned some observations, and working in this space for a few years.

The floundering political process has reduced the prospects for stabilizing Libya, more than ten years after the 2011 overthrow of longtime dictator Muammar al-Qadhafi. The UN plan was based on holding presidential elections scheduled for December 24, 2021; however, the elections were postponed by disagreements among the major factions over election ground rules. The dispute escalated in February when the eastern Libya-based parliament asserted that the term of prime minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, seated in Tripoli, had expired on the December 24 presidential election date. In March, the parliament confirmed a new prime minister, Fathi Bashagha, and a new cabinet and, in addition, endorsed a process to work toward holding national elections by May 2023. Dbeibeh has called the naming of a new government illegitimate and vows to remain in his post until national elections are held. Armed supporters have rallied to his side, and he has refused to allow Bashagha to enter Tripoli to take office. Dbeibah has proposed new election dates prior to the June 2022 expiration of the UN-backed reconciliation accord between the eastern and western factions. That election date favors his faction politically, because eastern Libyan leaders require time to build support among tribal groups and other factions in western Libya.\nAs the divisions between eastern and western Libyan leaders harden, signs of a potential return to armed conflict are growing with each day. Earlier this month, Khalifah Haftar, the commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA) and a key eastern Libyan political leader, withdrew his representatives from the joint military committee that was set up to de-conflict rival military movements. The committee has included five members from the Tripoli-based National Unity Government headed by Dbeibah and five representatives of Haftar's forces. Some activists in Libya accused Haftar of simultaneously ordering the closure of the coastal road linking Libya’s east and west, although there are no clear indications that the road is closed. A return to combat between contending factions would almost certainly hinder efforts to provide relief to the Libyan people who have been subjected to nearly constant fighting since Qadhafi’s overthrow. The United Nations estimates that at least 800,000 Libyans—more than 10% of the population—require humanitarian aid. Should the ceasefire break down, tensions will also increase among the various outside backers of the rival Libyan groups; Haftar and his eastern Libya allies are backed by Russia, neighboring Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates, whereas Tripoli-based Libyan leaders are supported primarily by Turkey. Qatar, which intervened militarily to help the rebellion against Qadhafi, reportedly has supplied some financial assistance to the Turkish effort. As of April, Russia might have redeployed Wagner Group mercenaries from Libya to Ukraine in order to reinforce its faltering war effort there, possibly reducing Haftar’s combat capabilities.\nU.S. officials are monitoring Libya closely, not only for the humanitarian impacts, potential spillover effects into other North African countries, and the possibility of destabilizing refugee flows to Europe, but also for the potential to further disrupt global energy markets. Oil prices have increased significantly since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, as U.S. and European sanctions have reduced Russia’s oil exportation. U.S. officials have failed in their efforts to convince various oil producers, particularly Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, to increase production as a step toward stabilizing oil prices. The dynamics in Libya have also contributed to the spike in oil prices, as rival factions seek to control Libya’s national assets and revenue sources. In March, Libya’s oil exports fell below 1 million barrels per day (mbd), from the usual baseline of 1.2 mbd. The drop was attributed to incursions by pro-Haftar armed tribal groups that shut down Libya’s al-Feel and Sharara oil fields; the latter, the country’s largest, produces 450,000 barrels per day. Both fields reopened after several days, following negotiations led by tribal leaders.\nIn mid-April, Libya’s national oil company said that it was forced to shut down Sharara again due to armed action by tribal groups protesting Dbeibah’s refusal to yield power. The company declared a force majeure—a legal move allowing it to free itself from contractual supply obligations due to factors beyond its control. On April 23, Libyan officials confirmed that an oil refinery at Zawiya, in western Libya, had been damaged by clashes among armed groups there. The infighting also largely rules out Libya from reaching and implementing the decisions necessary to increase exports of natural gas, the price of which has similarly spiked as a result of the Ukraine invasion. Libya is potentially able to supply more natural gas to Europe, which currently gets about 40% of its supply from Russia, given Libya’s strong gas production and close proximity to the continent. However, expanding natural gas exports requires investments that Libya cannot attract if it is on the verge of renewed civil conflict. In addition to the global impact on energy markets, a political solution is first and foremost critical domestically for the Libyan people, after more than a decade of instability. UN, U.S., European, and Arab mediators continue to try to work with all Libyan leaders to ensure a solution in the common interest.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line82313"}

[5] Traces of 2M2B have also been detected in various food substances, including fried bacon and cassava[6][7], rooibos tea[8] and fruits (such as apple and pineapple). We present the case of a 26-year-old patient with acute intoxication and dependence on 2-methyl-2-butanol (2m2b). This material is cheap, easily accessible, for example via the Internet, and is increasingly distributed. Especially for patients with polysubstance addiction or patients with legal restrictions on abstinence from alcohol, it is of great attraction. Due to its multiple psychotropic effects, this can easily lead to dangerous intoxication or withdrawal syndromes. Since the substance is not detectable by standard drug monitoring procedures, it is important to know its existence. However, once the substance is detected, detoxification appears to be manageable. Treatment of withdrawal symptoms using the CIWA-AR protocol (Sullivanâ et al., 1989), including diazepam and clonidine, has been shown to be effective and has prevented serious side effects.\nDoxepine was suitable for reducing internal tension and mild withdrawal symptoms. Our patient can be considered an excellent example of what Orsolini et al. called “psychonauts” (Orsolini, 2015). This formed group operates mainly online, orders substances via the Internet and has some knowledge of chemical and pharmacological properties. However, this is precisely where there is considerable danger, as potential health risks are trivialized. The concept of “e-psyconauts” could identify people who are close to this substance and be useful for colleagues in identifying patients at risk. Our case report offers possible clues for other treatment options and shows the difficulty of detecting this substance in clinical routine, as there is only a short window of about 2 days after consumption and sophisticated methods (more precisely: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) are required to obtain positive results. TAA is a colorless liquid with a burning taste[6] and an unpleasant odor[7] similar to paraldehyde with a hint of camphor. [8] TAA remains liquid at room temperature, making it a useful alternative to tert-butyl alcohol.\nTapered alcohols such as TAA are by-products of cereal fermentation and, therefore, traces of TAA are present in many alcoholic beverages. [10] Traces of TAA have been detected in other foods such as fried bacon[11], cassava[12] and rooibos tea. [13] TAA is also present in rabbit milk and appears to play a role as a pheromone, which induces breastfeeding in newborn rabbits. [14] As with any other GABA receptor agonist, repeated use and increased tolerance eventually lead to a abrupt withdrawal syndrome similar to withdrawal from alcohol, barbiturates or benzodiazepines, up to delirium tremens (“shakes”). Chronic use of this compound can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and may lead to psychological dependence in some users. If an addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal symptoms can occur if a person suddenly stops using it. 2-2-Butanol inhibits binding to a proconvulsant site at the GABA receptor,[10] causing negatively charged chloride ions to enter neurons and increase the excitation needed to trigger neurons. Because it is a tertiary alcohol, it cannot be converted to aldehydes by alcohol dehydrogenase (which causes hangovers associated with consuming large amounts of ethanol). This makes 2M2B significantly safer than primary alcohols. [11] However, a consequence of this is that 2-methyl-2-butanol has a prolonged duration of action with effects that last up to 12 hours after consumption. Fatal overdose can occur when GABAergic substances are combined with other tranquilizers such as opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, gabapentinoids, thienodiazepines or alcohol. [1] Compared to other tranquilizers of a similar nature, 2M2B is comparatively closer to alcohol than GHB in terms of subjective effect and is also significantly more sedative than alcohol, but less sedative than GHB.\nAn overdose causes symptoms similar to alcohol poisoning and is a medical emergency due to the sedative/depressive properties that manifest as life-threatening respiratory depression in the event of an overdose. Sudden loss of consciousness, concomitant respiratory and metabolic acidosis[17], rapid heartbeat, increased blood pressure, pupillary constriction, coma, respiratory depression[18] and death may result from overdose. The oral LD50 in rats is 1 g/kg. The subcutaneous LD50 in mice is 2.1 g/kg. [19] 2-Methyl-2-butanol (also known as tert-amyl alcohol or 2M2B) is a tertiary alcoholic substance that produces depressive, hypnotic and anxiolytic effects. In the past, it was used in anesthesia as a component of a warning liquid mixed with tribromoethanol and water. [3] It has a strong solvent smell reminiscent of gasoline, but has little taste. The simple structure and intoxicating effect of 2M2B led to its use as a recreational drug. [4] Tert-amyl alcohol (TAA) or 2-methylbutan-2-ol (2M2B) is a branched pentanol. 2-Methyl-2-butanol is also known as tert-amyl alcohol, 2M2B or amylene hydrate. 2-Methyl-2-butanol is an alcohol with the formula C5H11OH. 2-2-Butanol consists of butane, an alkyl chain of four carbons.\nThis chain is substituted in R 2 by a methyl group CH 3 and an alcohol group OH-. It is synthesized by the reaction of 2-methyl-2-butene with water in the presence of an acid catalyst. [9].

The deployed systems were recording data on outdated storage media. Specifically, data was recorded onto magnetic tapes using DAT (Digital Archive Tape) drives, and the FAA wanted to upgrade the system and software to perform data recording onto RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) storage devices, for many appropriate reasons such as reliability, redundancy, capacity, and performance. The effort was dubbed “CDR-R” for Continuous Data Recorder Replacement. The software changes required to make this transition were complex and non-trivial, requiring modifications to portions of the baseline code, some of which dated back to the 80s. Data recording is a critical component of the system – the FAA takes it very seriously, as they should, since this data is used not just for incident investigation purposes, but also to support data analysis of FAA operations.\nThe problem was that the scope of the changes that we estimated would be needed to implement the solution were such that they did not fit into the customer’s yearly budget and schedule… This seemed to me to be an opportunity to try a new delivery approach: First, inspired by Feature Driven Design (FDD,) I proposed that we divide the scope of changes into a set of ‘features’ such as ‘RAID recording’, ‘RAID synchronization’, ‘data transfer’, etc. Then, inspired by the spiral development model (described in section 3.3.2), I proposed an incremental delivery of the CDR-R changes in three phases: the first phase would provide basic RAID-based recording capabilities, the second would add additional monitoring and control capabilities for the RAIDs and provide data transfer tools to allow migration of data across various media and system installations, and finally the third phase would add some data maintenance functions. This new (in our program’s context) delivery model made the CDR-R transition more palatable for our customer and made for a better fit with their funding cycles, leading them to authorize the CDR-R development to begin.\nFor the first phase’s set of features, we employed our traditional waterfall approach: software requirements were developed to meet the system level requirements, and then a design to fulfill the software requirements, then code was developed to implement the design, then testing and integration. This phase completed with a software delivery containing the full scope of planned phase-1 modifications, however the performance of the development effort suffered from cost overruns and internal schedule slippage. A lot of rework was generated towards the end of the development phase, as we began to test the software and encountered complications when running in the target hardware environment. Several other problems required revisiting the requirements, the design, and underlying code implementation. In my opinion, at the root of these issues were two main root causes: Unclear/uncertain requirements, and a delayed ability to test the software.\nThese two issues have a compounding effect on each other: due to the waterfall approach of developing components in isolation of each other, the system functionality that we were trying to achieve only came to being at the tail-end of the development process, when all of the CSCIs (software components) were developed, tested in isolation, then integrated to produce the required functionality. Unfortunately, we typically only reach this point after 3/4ths or more of the schedule and budgeted effort have been consumed. This may not be problematic if requirements are well-defined, correct, complete, and unambiguous – but here we found this not to be the case. Identifying requirements issues that late in the development process meant several re-water-falling rework iterations of requirements/design/code at the very end of the development cycle when little time was left. Two key project performance measures, Schedule Performance Index (SPI) and Cost Performance Index (CPI), for this phase-1 of development were 0.82 SPI and 0.76 CPI, meaning that the software was behind schedule by 18%, and 24% over cost.\nFor the second phase, I proposed that we employ an Agile approach to development, based on the Scrum methodology (described later in this research.) Management was receptive to this proposition, and eager to support this effort, especially as the desire to “go agile” was being communicated top-down through the organization, exemplified by a corporate-backed initiative named “SWIFT” (Software Innovation for Tomorrow) that had begun piloting Agile practices on several other large programs in the company. Note that ours was not one of the SWIFT pilot programs, but an organic home-grown desire to employ Agile methods, with prior successes in AIG development and the PrOOD in mind.\nA small team of developers was assembled, trained in Scrum methodology, and produced the phase-2 software increment in three sprints of three weeks each. This is relatively fast in an organization where conducting a code inspection alone can eat up a week in development time. Phase-2 thus enjoyed an SPI of 1.07 (7% ahead of schedule) yet the CPI of 0.73 remained less than ideal.\nWhile the Scrum approach helped us beat schedule, our cost performance did not improve. Looking back, there are several factors that could explain this: The team was new to Scrum, required training sessions, and only had the chance to execute three sprints. We did not have a product owner or customer representatives involved so the requirements were still unclear and conflicting. A new web-based code review tool was deployed during our second sprint, but in retrospect was not optimally used and ended up causing wasted effort. We also had to deal with a slew of defects and issues from the phase-1 delivery; in other words we were building on top of a baseline that still had undiscovered defects. Finally, there was the overhead of trying to fit the agile software development model within an overarching heavyweight Integrated Product Development Process (IPDP) covering all of the phases of program execution.\nIt is important to note that the activity of “software development” fits within an integrated approach to product development that includes program processes such as business planning and requirements analysis, as shown in Figure 1.\nFigure 1 – Example Integrated Product Development Process\nPart of the problem with adopting Scrum within an environment such as shown in Figure 1 was that, as a Software Development Manager, only software development activities were within my purview, and thus only the software development team could adopt Scrum. Other parts of the engineering organization, such as System Engineering (SEs, producers of software requirements) and Software Integration and Test (SIs, integrators and testers of the system) were still operating in a traditional approach, where SEs hand off completed requirements to development, who in turn hand off completed code to SIs.\nSince Scrum was adopted just within the confines of software development, and not as a complete IPDP overhaul, this meant that the development team had to maintain the same “interfaces” to the other activities in the program, and had to produce the same work artifacts (e.g. design documentation, review packages), employ the same level of process rigor– all of which was monitored by the Software Quality Assurance (SQA) oversight group. This included holding all of the required inspections and feeding back progress to management, which expected clear Earned Value (EV) based reports of progress.\nYet with all of this, Scrum seemed to energize the development team, produce working code much faster, and speed up the experience gain of new engineers. Clearly there was some benefit to Agile. As a result I decided to pursue this research on Agile development for my graduate thesis in the M.I.T. Systems Design & Management (SDM) program. The research would take a “deep dive” into Agile, and take a close look at agile practices with the goal of understanding how to integrate them in a CMMI level 5 software engineering environment. During my time at SDM I also discovered the worlds of Systems Thinking and Systems Dynamics (SD), and found the SD approach to be the best tool for understanding the emergent behaviour of a ‘complex socio-technical system’, in this case the software development enterprise.\nThe Agile Genome\nA Brief Review of Agile Methodologies\nThe Software Capability Maturity Model (SW-CMM)\nWaterfall and Big Design Up Front (BDUF)","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1700066"}

On September 11, 2001, the structure was substantially damaged by debris when the nearby North Tower collapsed. The building’s internal fire suppression system lacked water pressure to fight the fires. The collapse made the old 7 World trade Center the first steel skyscraper known to have collapsed primarily due to uncontrolled fires. Construction of the new 7 WTC began in 2002 and was completed in 2006. The new building is 52 stories tall, making it the 28th-tallest in New York. It is built on a smaller footprint than the original, and is bounded by Greenwich, Vesey, Washington, and Barclay Streets on the east, south, west, and north, respectively. A small park across Greenwich Street occupies space that was part of the original building’s footprint. The current building’s design emphasizes safety, with a reinforced concrete core, wider stairways, and thicker fireproofing on steel columns. It also incorporates numerous green design features. It was the first commercial office building to receive the U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certification, where it won a gold rating. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The original 7 WTC was a 47-story building, designed by Emery Roth & Sons,. with a red granite facade.\nIt opened in May 1987, becoming the seventh structure of the World Trade Centre. The ground-breaking ceremony was hosted on October 2, 1984, with the building’s opening ceremony being held on October 3, 1984. It had a gypsum-based fire-proofing elements, which had a three-hour fire rating for steel beams, and a three girders and three gusses for structural steel columns on floors 11-12. The substation had a caisson foundation designed to carry the weight of a future building of 25 stories containing 600,000 sq ft. The final design for 7 World trade Center was for a much larger building than originally planned when the substation was built. Above the typical 7th floor’s structure was a tube-frame design, with lateral stability and distribution of loads between the new caissons, providing a structural diaphragm for the building. The typical building’s structure is a typical seven-story structure with a cylindrical design. The 5th floor functioned as a typical typical seven floor structure, providing lateral stability for the 6th, 7th, and 8th floors. The 9/11 attacks destroyed the original structure, which served the entire World Trade center complex, which occupied the eastern quarter of the complex, and the entire eastern half of the WTC complex, occupied the western quarter.

This week, we look at the firms that got the work in a record-setting year for the Big Law capital markets practice. Sign up to receive this column in your inbox on Thursday mornings.\nI wrote a few times in 2020 about the red-hot capital markets practice for Big Law firms. It was a roller coaster year for lawyers who advise on initial public offerings, debt issuances, and other financings.\nBut now the full annual numbers from capital markets are in, and even if everybody knew what direction they were headed (up), it’s worth sharing the results. That’s because they could help to power a trend we’ve talked about and that we are already seeing in action a week into 2021: The largest, richest firms are investing in talented lawyers to bolster their leading positions.\nIn the U.S., the value of IPOs priced in 2020 hit nearly $150 billion, up 43% from the prior year.\nBetween advising issuers and underwriters, four law firms in 2020 advised on U.S.-based IPOs valued at more than $20 billion in total—a feat last accomplished by a law firm in 2012, when Simpson Thacher & Bartlett advised on $25 billion worth.\nDavis Polk & Wardwell advised on IPOs valued at more than $30 billion—more than any other firm, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That is nearly double the value the firm advised on during 2019.\n“It was definitely a record year for us in capital markets and a very, very strong year for the firm,” said Michael Kaplan, a member of Davis Polk’s three-person management committee and head of its corporate department.\nLatham & Watkins came in at No. 2 by total value of IPO work, advising on more than $23 billion worth, compared to about $7.4 billion in 2019. Kirkland & Ellis and Ropes & Gray also advised on IPOs totaling more than $20 billion in 2020.\nCompanies navigating an economy stunted by the global pandemic and accompanying lockdowns also issued debt at record levels last year.\nThere was nearly $2 trillion worth of investment grade corporate bonds issued in 2020, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s up almost 60% from 2019. Davis Polk again led the way, advising issuers and underwriters on deals valued at nearly $500 billion.\nIt wasn’t just blue-chip companies looking to raise capital. With the pandemic stressing a wide range of industries, lower-rated companies issued high-yield debt, or “junk bonds,” in huge amounts. Nearly $440 billion of high-yield debt was issued—up about 50% from 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\nCahill Gordon & Reindel advised on nearly $100 billion worth of these deals, leading the way among law firms. Latham & Watkins advised on the second-most, worth nearly $87 billion.\nWilliam Hartnett, chairman of the Cahill Gordon’s executive committee, said 2020 was “a very strong year” for the firm in both corporate and litigation.\n“It always puts wind in your sails when you finish a very good year,” he said. “But come January 1, we reset the odometer to zero. The challenge will be to continue the upward trajectory, which we are confident we can do.”\nMany firms with a highly rated capital markets practice will likely be reporting strong financial years in 2020. That could provide an opportunity to bolster those practices.\nLatham & Watkins’ corporate practice chair Marc Jaffe said it was a “record year” for the firm’s capital markets practice, and the firm has already been re-investing in the group.

The sector is extremely divided, with the majority of operators employing only one or four people.\nThere are only a few major auction houses in the industry, such as Sotheby’s and Christie’s. The Art Dealers sector has benefited from growth in disposable income and the percentage of households making more than $100,000 over the five years to 2020.\nHowever, the era was also characterized by political and economic instability, which caused sales declines sufficient to offset growth. Overall, sales for the Art Dealers sector is expected to fall by 5.9 percent on an annualized basis, totaling $7.5 billion.\nRevenue is expected to decline 28.7 percent in 2020 due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and its economic implications. Profitability in the industry is also expected to fall.\nLearn more about business for sale industry economics, which can help you make informed decisions about the future of your business in the competitive marketplace of Mergers and Acquisitions. To learn more continue reading.\nAdditional Information about Art Dealers\nThe Art Dealers industry consists of businesses that mainly sell original and limited-edition art pieces. Art galleries that exhibit pieces of art for retail sale are not included. The Art Dealers sector has had a mixed five-year period from 2010 to 2020.\nHowever, income is projected to fall dramatically over the next five years, falling at an annualized rate of 5.9 percent to $7.5 billion. This involves a forecast 28.7 percent drop in 2020 alone.\nFor the next five years, sales for the Art Dealers market is expected to change direction and intensify. According to research, sales will rise at a 5.9 percent annualized rate to $10.0 billion in the five years to 2025.\nPer capita disposable income and the Consumer Confidence Index are projected to rise over the next five years, driving demand for business operators.\nFurthermore, modern art is expected to expand in importance, and interest from museums looking to protect potential client flows by purchasing prestigious works of art is expected to rise.\nThis business consists mainly of art galleries and art auction houses that sell original and limited-edition artwork. The corporations buy artwork from an artist or private owner and then market it to customers, with little to no further product creation. Auction houses that put buyers and sellers together and charge a fee are also included in the business.\nThe ratio of capital to labor determines the capital intensity. Depreciation and salary expenses are used as proxies in the lack of official statistics on capital and labor expenses. For every dollar spent on labor, the average Art Dealers business operator spends $0.05 on capital.\nThis ratio illustrates the industry’s concentration on hiring and maintaining high-quality workers and suggests a low degree of capital intensity. During this time, capital intensity has only marginally grown, and it is expected to stay low for the next five years.\nThe operations of sourcing and appraising artwork are critical to the profitability of an art dealer, and they necessitate highly skilled labor. Retailers and auctioneers must also have a thorough understanding of the items and the capacity to appraise new stock.\nMarketing, collecting an inventory of the objects for sale, generating estimates of how much an auction will make, and setting auction dates and locations are all responsibilities of auctioneers. They are first and primarily salespeople on auction day, convincing consumers to purchase stuff.\nSourcing, evaluating, and analyzing the saleability of artwork are critical to the success of a small art gallery. Dealers frequently build bonds with one another. In order to have access to artwork, dealers generally build connections with artists and purchasers.\nThe building of visually beautiful premises that inspire both a sense of expertise and creativity is the emphasis of capital spending. In addition, a corporation must safeguard exceptionally expensive merchandise against theft, damage, and the elements.\nThis critical success aspect necessitates the installation of a contemporary security system that protects not only the outside of a building from attackers after hours but also the artwork inside from theft or damage during business hours.\nTemperature, humidity, and light monitoring devices are also vital, especially for older pieces of art that are more susceptible to climatic fluctuations. Most insurance plans need the installation of sophisticated security and climate control system.\nThe demand for art is determined by affluent individuals’ household expenditures, consumer attitude, current trends, and the artwork’s restricted supply.\nBecause art is a luxury item, it is very sensitive to economic cyclical trends; demand is boosted when wealthy individuals have excess funds when the economy is doing well, but demand shrivels during downturns as consumer sentiment and expenditure plummet, resulting in far fewer art sales, contributing to the Art Dealers industry’s volatility.\nThe public and critical taste for artists of a certain style, locality, or topic determines demand for artwork, particularly contemporary art. Wealthy collectors are keen to spend surplus income on artwork that vendors are similarly willing to sell for big sums of money during periods of expansion.\nAs a result of this tendency, famous art dealers are building buzz around artists and speculative movements that are lauded as cutting-edge. This enthusiasm leads to an upsurge in the acquisition of modern and one-of-a-kind art.\nHowever, it is difficult to distinguish hype and short-term trends from more long-term demand or critical acclaim with these types of art sales, and as a result, they are subject to large drops in value as soon as the economy suffers a downturn or an artist is not as successful as they were expected to be.\nThe contemporary art market’s volatility adds significantly to the industry’s overall instability. Furthermore, artwork may only be offered for purchase on a periodic basis. When rare works of art are offered for sale, the proceeds are usually higher.\nSales of paintings by well-known artists are rarer and consequently more expensive. In November 2009, Sotheby’s auctioned off a renowned painting by Andy Warhol, ‘200 One Dollar Bills,’ for $43.8 million, which was double the estimated price, despite the economic slump.\nThis is especially true of artwork done during the time of the ancient masters. Prices soar as a result of such strong worldwide demand and the uncommon possibilities to purchase such items, contributing to big positive swings in industry revenue.\nArt and Office Supply Manufacturing\nArt Supply Stores","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1600926"}

That seriously hampered any hopes that the U.S. firm — which is struggling to grow its userbase worldwide — had in China, but the service does still have a hardcore base of loyalists who use it in the country.\nPrevious estimates have pegged Twitter’s China-based following as being as high as 35.5 million users, but the actual number appears to be much lower. According to a source inside Twitter, who spoke to TechCrunch on the condition of anonymity, its service has around 10 million active users in China.\nThat number itself is an estimate, one that is used internally, because even Twitter isn’t fully sure. That’s because it is hugely challenging to tally up China-based users by virtue of them connecting to the service via VPN software which allows them to use an internet connection outside of China, thus bypassing the country’s web censorship system. So, a China-based user accessing Twitter on a VPN will show up as being located in the U.S., UK, Singapore or wherever else their VPN is set to.\n“We do not comment on specific number of users in any country. Our consumer service is censored and blocked in mainland China today,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch via email.\nEither way, the figure is small: 10 million represents a mere drop of Twitter’s 310 million total active users — it counts 65 million of those in the U.S., its largest single market, with the remaining 245 million overseas. It is also a tiny fraction of the 688 million internet users in the country, according to government data. That figure, taken from December 2015, means that, for the first time, over half of China’s population is now online.\nTwitter has a growing business in China, anchored by an executive who controversially spent time in her early career working on military security for the government, but its userbase in China isn’t part of that. Local services like chat app WeChat, which contains social features and has multiple hundreds of millions of active users in China, and microblogging service Weibo are the dominant social media. Instead, Twitter makes money in China by offering Chinese companies and media a gateway to global audiences by advertising on its service. That’s exactly the strategy that Facebook employs, with both services proving to be popular advertising and distribution channels for China’s state-run media, which among the most lucrative clients.\n“As a global platform, we are already engaged with advertisers, content providers and influencers across Greater China to help them reach audiences around the world. We are focusing on three Chinese business audiences that can leverage our global platform: continue to serve export advertisers, do more with publishers/creators, and reach out to developers,” Twitter added in a statement.\nIf it isn’t critical to its business, why is Twitter’s internal estimate for its China userbase worthy of note?\nWell, it helps sketch out a figure for the number of people who use VPNs in China, an oft-influential section that includes journalists, activists, prominent business leaders and decision makers. It is hard to fully quantify this block of internet users, though, even with Twitter’s estimate. Not everyone using a VPN will use Twitter, but it is likely that a large portion of VPN and Twitter users overlap. Certainly you can’t use Twitter in China without a VPN.\nIn that respect, Twitter’s China estimate — while not mission-critical for Twitter’s business — gives a glimpse at the number of ‘global web consumers’ who leap over China’s Great Firewall of censorship to read and consume whatever they want on the internet.\n“If there are 10 million Chinese on Twitter that is great news. Twitter is one of the last great bastions of relatively free speech. When was the last time 10 million Chinese could freely say what they feel, on any platform, without fear of reprisal?” Charlie Smith, one of the pseudonymous founders of anti-censorship group Great Fire, told TechCrunch via email.\nGreat Fire released a ranking index to give greater clarify around China-specific VPNs today, and Smith said he believes that “there are growing pockets of ordinary people who want to circumvent censorship so they can access whatever information they choose.”\n“It’s fantastic that Twitter can provide us with an indication of how big this group might be,” the Great Fire founder added.\nIt is highly unlikely that Twitter will take the necessary steps that might get it unblocked in China — that would mean caving in to censorship demands and self-policing user content, as LinkedIn has done — while there’s already fierce competition in social media, so don’t expect that China-based user number to grow much any time soon.","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line705898"}

Because of this, the data they collect isn't per se accessible to them– BioRaptor wants to change that with their tool\nIdan Ben Tovim / 27 Nov 2022 • 3 min read\nCredit: BioRaptor\nScientific developments play a big part in tech and societal advancements, be it cultured meat, milk that does not come from cows, new medications and vaccines, and innovative climatic solutions to name a few. Most of these developments wouldn't be possible without other technological tools. But scientists often find themselves with mountains of data and don't know what to do with it. This is where the new Israeli startup BioRaptor wants to enter the picture.\nScientists don't have enough tools\nBioraptor is developing tools for the field of synthetic biology which is where biology and other technology come together to produce new products that can really change the way we live. But the R&D processes of companies in this field leave huge amounts of data unused and therefore slow down the development process. But by using BioRaptor's system, perhaps this will change. BioRaptor's development can take data, analyze it, decipher it, and with the help of AI also provide insights that will allow scientists to advance their research and development processes. \"We believe that to be successful, scientists and engineers need to be equipped with tools that they can use themselves. Only by making deep insights accessible to scientists will it be possible to really move forward quickly and turn what might be considered science fiction today into reality,\" explains Yaron David, co-founder and CTO of Bioraptor, a neuroscience Ph.D. turned software engineer.\nAccording to him, the conditions necessary for optimal production of products such as transgenic steak or cow-free milk are simply unknown. To find out what the optimal conditions are, scientists are busy with long experiments. But Bioraptor wants to guide them using artificial intelligence instead: \"One way is through artificial intelligence-based sensors. We use sensors that have been around for decades and by learning the conditions, create an image in real-time of what is happening inside the organism. This basically allows scientists a new way to take a look at what is happening inside the organism and predict what will make it grow larger or express more of the product.\"\nFinding their way back to one another\nDavid met his co-founder, Ori Zakin (CEO) when they founded the Emerge Clinical Solutions development center together, which developed NLP-based products to help doctors read information from patients' personal files and make it more accessible to them. The two split up to different jobs– one at Drivenets and the other at Assured Allies, but eventually met up again sometime later. David explained how they decided to focus on the world of biology by meeting with several companies in the field to try to understand what solutions they were looking for. \"After a few months, we noticed a recurring problem… Luckily, we knew we had an advantage since we could bring the knowledge we had accumulated from our pasts and help all those scientists and companies; We knew we could build them a product that would really improve the profit line.\"\nZakin says that he was surprised to discover how few tools there are for scientists: \"Along the way, we discovered that the people who produce the medicines of tomorrow, futuristic food, and solutions for global warming are the ones who receive the fewest tools for machine learning and access to complex data. This is an opportunity for me, as a software engineer, to create a real revolution in an industry that makes the world a better place.\" This past Friday (Nov. 25), Bioraptor also announces a fundraising round of 3 million dollars led by lool Ventures and CPT Capital, with the participation of FoodHack and several interesting entrepreneurs such as Danny Grander (from Snyk), Yuval Weisglass (from TowerSec and Ansa), and Saar Dickman (from Dynamic Infrastructure and TowerSec). The company plans to expand the capabilities of its platform, while also broadening its relevant fields from imaging, fermentation, and cell cultures to genetics.\ninvestments startups biotech Startup news Startup Nation\nBorn with a joystick in hand, this guy has way too many gadgets but too little time to play with them.

Children struggling with obesity should be evaluated and treated early and aggressively, with medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for those as young as 13 who qualify, according to new guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday, Jan. 9, 2023. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December 2022, found that Wegovy helped teens reduce their body mass index by about 16% on average, better than the results in adults. (Novo Nordisk via AP)\nNew guidance: Use drugs, surgery early for obesity in kids\nby: JONEL ALECCIA, Associated Press\nChildren struggling with obesity should be evaluated and treated early and aggressively, including with medications for kids as young as 12 and surgery for those as young as 13, according to new guidelines released Monday.\nThe longstanding practice of “watchful waiting,” or delaying treatment to see whether children and teens outgrow or overcome obesity on their own only worsens the problem that affects more than 14.4 million young people in the U.S. Left untreated, obesity can lead to lifelong health problems, including high blood pressure, diabetes and depression.\n“Waiting doesn’t work,” said Dr. Ihuoma Eneli, co-author of the first guidance on childhood obesity in 15 years from the American Academy of Pediatrics. “What we see is a continuation of weight gain and the likelihood that they’ll have (obesity) in adulthood.”\nFor the first time, the group’s guidance sets ages at which kids and teens should be offered medical treatments such as drugs and surgery — in addition to intensive diet, exercise and other behavior and lifestyle interventions, said Eneli, director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\nIn general, doctors should offer adolescents 12 and older who have obesity access to appropriate drugs and teens 13 and older with severe obesity referrals for weight-loss surgery, though situations may vary.\nThe guidelines aim to reset the inaccurate view of obesity as “a personal problem, maybe a failure of the person’s diligence,” said Dr. Sandra Hassink, medical director for the AAP Institute for Healthy Childhood Weight, and a co-author of the guidelines.\n“This is not different than you have asthma and now we have an inhaler for you,” Hassink said.\nYoung people who have a body mass index that meets or exceeds the 95th percentile for kids of the same age and gender are considered obese. Kids who reach or exceed that level by 120% are considered to have severe obesity. BMI is a measure of body size based on a calculation of height and weight.\nObesity affects nearly 20% of kids and teens in the U.S. and about 42% of adults, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe group’s guidance takes into consideration that obesity is a biological problem and that the condition is a complex, chronic disease, said Aaron Kelly, co-director of the Center for Pediatric Obesity Medicine at the University of Minnesota.\n“Obesity is not a lifestyle problem. It is not a lifestyle disease,” he said. “It predominately emerges from biological factors.”\nThe guidelines come as new drug treatments for obesity in kids have emerged, including approval late last month of Wegovy, a weekly injection, for use in children ages 12 and older. Different doses of the drug, called semaglutide, are also used under different names to treat diabetes. A recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk, helped teens reduce their BMI by about 16% on average, better than the results in adults.\nWithin days of the Dec. 23 authorization, pediatrician Dr. Claudia Fox had prescribed the drug for one of her patients, a 12-year-old girl.\n“What it offers patients is the possibility of even having an almost normal body mass index,” said Fox, also a weight management specialist at the University of Minnesota. “It’s like a whole different level of improvement.”\nThe drug affects how the pathways between the brain and the gut regulate energy, said Dr. Justin Ryder, an obesity researcher at Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.\n“It works on how your brain and stomach communicate with one another and helps you feel more full than you would be,” he said.\nStill, specific doses of semaglutide and other anti-obesity drugs have been hard to get because of recent shortages caused by manufacturing problems and high demand, spurred in part by celebrities on TikTok and other social media platforms boasting about enhanced weight loss.\nIn addition, many insurers won’t pay for the medication, which costs about $1,300 a month. “I sent the prescription yesterday,” Fox said. “I’m not holding my breath that insurance will cover it.”\nOne expert in pediatric obesity cautioned that while kids with obesity must be treated early and intensively, he worries that some doctors may turn too quickly to drugs or surgery.\n“It’s not that I’m against the medications,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a longtime specialist in pediatric endocrinology at the University of California, San Francisco. “I’m against the willy-nilly use of those medications without addressing the cause of the problem.”\nLustig said children must be evaluated individually to understand all of the factors that contribute to obesity. He has long blamed too much sugar for the rise in obesity. He urges a sharp focus on diet, particularly ultraprocessed foods that are high in sugar and low in fiber.\nDr. Stephanie Byrne, a pediatrician at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said she’d like more research about the drug’s efficacy in a more diverse group of children and about potential long-term effects before she begins prescribing it regularly.\n“I would want to see it be used on a little more consistent basis,” she said. “And I would have to have that patient come in pretty frequently to be monitored.”\nAt the same time, she welcomed the group’s new emphasis on prompt, intensive treatment for obesity in kids.\n“I definitely think this is a realization that diet and exercise is not going to do it for a number of teens who are struggling with this – maybe the majority,” she said.\nAn insider’s guide to the UP200\nEntrepreneur in Residence Program launches at Innovate …\n8 Meth dealers sentenced from the Western Upper Peninsula","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1428367"}

The SMART Grants Program is made possible by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, signed by President Biden on November 15, 2021. The program will offer up to $100 million in grants annually over the next five years and will fund projects that use data and technology to solve real-world challenges facing communities today.\n“As we undertake the most ambitious infrastructure investment in generations, thanks to the President’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we can and must plan for the transportation needs of the future,” said U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “From connected vehicles that make driving safer, to smart traffic signals that reduce congestion, to sensors to detect the quality of pavement to help prioritize repair, our SMART grants will fund technology that makes people’s lives better in communities across America.”\nThe SMART program will fund purpose-driven innovation and focus on building data and technology capacity and expertise. The Program seeks proposals from public sector entities that will carry out demonstration projects in the following domains to address key transportation priorities:\n“Achieving our transportation priorities related to safety, economic strength, equity, and climate requires bold investment in new technologies and approaches,” said Dr. Robert C. Hampshire, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology and Chief Science Officer at US DOT. “SMART supports a broad portfolio of projects across the country that will serve as beacons as we move toward a transportation system that is data-driven, values-based, and technology-enabled.\nThe second is the Federal Highway Administration’s $60 million Advanced Transportation Technology and Innovation (ATTAIN) program to promote advanced technologies to improve safety and reduce travel times for drivers and transit riders and that can serve as national examples. As a result of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, ATTAIN-eligible projects will be evaluated on how they consider climate change and environmental justice impacts – including how they reduce transportation-related air pollution and address the disproportionate impacts on disadvantaged communities. In addition, projects are evaluated on their economic impact and potential to create jobs.\nThe SMART Notice of Funding (NOFO) is open now and can be found at www.grants.gov Applications must be submitted by 5:00 PM EDT on Friday, November 18, 2022.

Due to the Swiss Banking system’s secrecy and privacy, the world’s top politicians, business people, moneylenders, drug lords, and criminals keep their billions of dollars in the Swiss banks. Until 2021 total amount of deposit money at Swiss banks was more than 2 trillion Swiss Franc (2.25 trillion CHF), where foreign clients held 1.5 trillion Swiss Franc. In 2021, Swiss Banks Bangladeshi clients’ money totaled 871.1 million Swiss Franc or BDT 8,265 core, which was about BDT 5,333 core in 2020. Due to the highest level of security and privacy provided by Swiss banks, people love to deposit their both legal and illegal money in those banks.\nPeople love to deposit both legal and illegal money in those Swiss banks because of their highest level of security and privacy.\nWhat is the Swiss Bank?\nThe Swiss bank does not identify any specific bank, rather it is a collection of more than 240 banks in Switzerland that are considered as Swiss banks. Switzerland’s banking system was established around the 16th century. In 1713, the “Grand Council of Geneva” decided not to disclose their financial information for their upper class citizens. Swiss banks started giving them this facility when kings and queens, lords and ladies along with top business personalities were looking for a safe place to store their money, gold, and other precious jewels. Later at the beginning of the 18th century, several bankers from France, which was closely associated country of the Grand Council of Geneva, started living in Switzerland. As Switzerland and Germany are neighboring countries, in 1865, a Swiss credit bank was established in Switzerland, where half of the total funding capital was financed from Germany. In 1912, the first banking association in Switzerland, the Swiss bankers association, or SBA, was founded.\nPrivateness, political stability, and economic consensus are the pillars of the Swiss banking system. However, during the great depression in the 1930s, two Swiss bankers leaked their client’s bank account information. As a result, under French and German pressure in 1934, the Swiss Banking Act was enacted in Switzerland to prevent such things from happening again. However today, to supervise all types of banking activities in Switzerland, three organizations: the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), the Swiss Federal Banking Commission (SFBC), and the Anti-Money Laundering Control Authority were merged, and the Financial Market Supervisory Authority or FINMA was formed. Apart from the legalization of financial markets and operating the market’s general function, FINMA’s primary objective is to protect creditors, investors, and insurance holders.\nTotal of 240+ banks in Switzerland are considered Swiss banks.\nSwiss Bank’s Secrecy & Privacy\nAccording to article 47 of the Swiss banking act, without the client’s consent, no Swiss bank or its officials can disclose any banking information of their client to any country’s government or tax authorities. If any bankers violate this rule, he/she will be imprisoned for five years. Furthermore, it is also mentioned in the article that, if any criminal activities are confirmed against a client and his/her direct involvement in the crime can be proven, the client’s banking information will be eligible for sharing.\nHowever, in 2014, a contract was signed under the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development or OECD by a total of 50 countries along with Switzerland, where under the terms, countries can share the financial information of their respective taxpayers with the government or tax authorities. Even after that, from the very beginning to now, Swiss banks maintain the tradition of keeping account holders’ information totally private and secure. Because of its strict privacy maintenance procedure, Swiss banks have become a go-to place for many tax frauds, money launderers, and wealthy people worldwide to keep their assets as they don’t want to reveal their amount of assets and their source. In the last 100 years, many tried to sabotage the secrecy of the Swiss banks. But none of them were successful which is evident from the popularity of Swiss banks.\nThe rules for opening an account in Swiss banks are the same as opening an account in any other bank. However, there are a few documents that must be submitted for opening an international resident account like passport, address verification, deposit amount source, and client beneficiary identification etc. However, to open an account in a Swiss bank, the client must be over 18 years old and physically present at the bank. Before opening an account, the bank authority verifies these documents, and if any record or financial transaction turns out to be illegal, then the bank authority cancels the application.\nRequirements for opening international resident’s account\nMostly, the applications to open accounts for politicians, drug lords, or wealthy individuals to deposit their ill-gotten gains have the biggest cancellation rate. But still, these individuals use their power to create shell corporations and entities, forge transaction histories through them, open bank accounts in Switzerland against illegal funds and assets, and keep their money there for years. Several banks in Switzerland provide numbered accounts to their account holders. In the case of such statements, the real identity of the account holder is kept secret by allocating a multi-digit number and providing a code name like Cardinal, Octopussy, and Cello as a supplement to that number which is restricted only to the client and selected banking officials. Swiss bank account holders don’t use Swiss bank checks, debit or credit cards for regular transactions because they fear losing their privacy.\nSwiss bank account holders don’t use checks, debit, or credit cards because of their privacy purpose.\nThe real identity of the account holder is kept secret by allocating a multi-digit number and providing a code name like Cardinal, Octopussy, and Cello as a supplement to that number\nMoreover, to maintain the secrecy and security of account holders’ deposited assets, Swiss Bank vaults and bunkers are kept at various secret locations. According to Swiss Defense Department estimates, 6 out of 10 military bunkers were available for sale in the 1980s, which were bought by some Swiss bank back then. Also, several Swiss bank vaults are made by cutting mountains under the Swiss Alps.\nAccording to Bloomberg, the main chamber of the vault has to be passed through highly skilled security guards and two levels of defense gates. There, the 3.5-tonne metal vault door can be opened only after an authorized bank official inputs a secret code on the security screen of the vault door and completes an iris scan and facial recognition. Because of this high-end security, wealthy individuals and business people from different countries feel confident about keeping their money and other valuables in Swiss banks.\nBesides protecting client privacy, Swiss banks provide investment-related advice and wealth management services to their depositors.\nIn addition, Swiss banks also provide consultation services to general customers on various issues, like current and savings accounts, mortgages, loans, pensions, insurance management, and digital banking. However, the amount of return on investment against depositing money in Swiss banks is much lower than in other countries. According to the central bank in September 2022, the policy rate of Switzerland is -0.25 percent. However, Switzerland’s economy is relatively stable and robust. Even in this ongoing global inflation, the country’s economy and currency stand firm where the per dollar is exchanging at 0.95 Swiss Franc. That means the Swiss Franc is stronger than the US Dollar.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Switzerland’s inflation rate hit a four-decade high of 3.4 percent because of the Russia and Ukraine war in 2022. In comparison, the USA’s inflation rate over the same period exceeded 9 percent. However, according to the Swiss central bank’s June forecast, the country’s inflation rate will fall to 1.9 percent in 2023 and 1.6 percent in 2024. Therefore, Switzerland’s economy is in a very stable position despite various adverse economic conditions. Therefore, there is a low possibility of a liquidity crisis in the country. A strong economy also ensures that money does not decline in value much, even if it is deposited in a bank.\nIn fact, in 2000, if someone had deposited $1 million in Swiss francs in a Swiss bank, the value of that money would have increased to about $1.8 million dollars today. Because of such economic stability, privacy, and security, the world’s rich, wealthy and unscrupulous feel comfortable storing money and assets in Swiss banks.\nIn 2000, If someone had deposited $1 million in Swiss francs in a Swiss bank, the value of that money would have increased to about $1.8 million dollars today.\nWhy American Express (AMEX) is So Popular and Successful?\nWhy Amazon is So Successful and Popular?\nWhy is PlayStation More Popular Than Xbox or Nintendo?","source":"cc/2023-06/en_head_0000.json.gz/line1135478"}

Unfortunately, for me, it was yet another walking simulator with a twist.\nYes, I’m sorry to preempt my own conclusion somewhat, but the reality is that no matter how it is dressed up — whether as a psychological horror, or against the backdrop of an electropunk alternative universe — wandering along a linear path watching a story unfold is beginning to wear thin on me.\nWhere Lost Ember is concerned, the player takes control of a wolf that was formerly a member of the Yanrana, a race of fictional Mesoamerican-esque native people who believe that their souls ascend to The City of Light upon death. For some reason, our wolf has been denied access to this promised land, and is instead forced to wander the land watching the story of their life unfold whilst a second spirit — also chained to the mortal realm — narrates for them.\nAside from the fact that players control a wolf for most of Lost Ember, the game introduces a further unique element in that the player can possess other animals that they encounter. Some of these animals have unique abilities such as flight, or the ability to crawl into small spaces or dig beneath walls. These abilities are generally the only form of puzzle in the game, and the player will begin to recognise the presence of certain animals and associate them with a particular kind of exploration.\nThe aim of Lost Ember is purely narrative. There are no enemies to fight, no bosses to defeat and no proper challenges to solve. Instead, the game draws players in through the extremely high standard of voice acting and the generally intriguing story. I won’t provide any spoilers here, but this is a tale of twists, turns, betrayals and tragedy, as well as undertones of rebellion and revenge.\nMost of the cutscenes (of which there are many) are signposted by red smoke that billows out across the expansive levels. One of the reasons why I get a Mesoamerican vibe from the Yanrama is because the game feels very much as though it is set in the breathtaking mountainous regions of South America, and the crumbling architecture is often square and highly symmetrical in nature.\nThere is certainly some merit in exploring the world of Lost Ember both because of where it is set and because you’ll do so from the perspective of a handful of different animals, but ultimately the experience is largely as linear as any other game in this genre. Where it does allow players the freedom to explore – when playing as a bird, for example — it often rewards with largely pointless collectables and a good degree of disorientation, so I was generally happier to find my way back to one of the more obvious paths.\nOf course, much of what games like Lost Ember offer is in the actual journey, and I find the experience of hopping from one animal to another quite mixed. As the wolf, our heroine moves beautifully, flowing gracefully through deep grass and up steep hillsides with ease, but when the jump button is pressed, a clunky and unnatural animation takes over, and the poor collision detection and lack of physics betray that this is not an action game or a platformer.\nPick another animal and you’ll usually find something to smile about. Ducks, for example, are easy to fly with lots of manoeuvrability, but can’t really gain height once they have taken off. Ducklings, on the other hand, can barely fly at all. A hummingbird can zip around extremely rapidly and can hover at any height but makes for quite a jarring method of flight.\nSome of the ground-based mammals (which I can’t easily identify) have little abilities that the game actually calls “Silly Things” that activate when the D-Pad is pressed. These include features like eating fruits, or lying down for a snooze. One of these creatures can roll up into a ball and speed down hills, whilst another can dig beneath loose stone walls to knock them down — or simply dig for underground mushrooms.\nPlaying around with these animals is always mildly entertaining, but for me, it was never more than that. The visuals in Lost Ember are decent but more stylish than they are detailed, so whilst others might use words like “cute” to describe them, I simply didn’t feel that level of affection for anything in the game. With that in mind, I played with the simple intention of getting to the next cut scene most of the time.\nAs I mentioned earlier, these cutscenes are very well done and the voice acting, in particular, is superb. Each one is played out by ghost-like characters that represent people from the distant past, and the game achieves a lovely juxtaposition of the animals and natural things that exist in the now, compared with the human ghosts and their technologies – now long since destroyed — of the past.\nUltimately, when the game ended, I felt satisfied with the narrative outcome and relieved that the actual gameplay had reached an end. I’m not saying that I didn’t enjoy the overall experience of Lost Ember, but I would say that I felt that the unique aspects of the game had run their course, and that I was ready to move onto the next, perhaps more exhilarating game.\nIf you’re a big animal fan and you like walking simulators, then Lost Ember might certainly be worth a look. It certainly has a strong narrative and some great voiceovers that easily match the best in the business. What it lacks is a sense of fear, or wonder or anything else that is truly emotive.\nYes, the story tugs at the heartstrings and is certainly interesting, and there’s no doubt that the gameplay is unique in the genre, but are those things enough to raise Lost Ember above mediocrity? If so, I’d say only just, and only if this is a genre that you’re really interested in.\nPurchase Lost Ember on Humble Bundle.\nYou can find Lost Ember on PS4, Xbox One and Steam.\nLost EmberMooneye StudiosPCPS4Xbox One\nMatthew Smail 514 posts 47 comments\nMatt is B3's resident Head of Board Games.

Field\nThe disclosure relates generally to network security and more specifically to preventing Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks between data processing devices connected to a network.\nIn network security, a man-in-the-middle attack is where an attacker secretly intercepts, relays, and possibly alters data, such as messages or transactions, between two network devices. For example, the man-in-the-middle attacker makes independent connections with both network devices and relays data between them, making the devices believe that they are directly communicating with one another over the network connection. Thus, the attacker is able to intercept, read, and then pass data between the two devices. In addition, the attacker may alter intercepted data and possibly inject new data. However, a man-in-the-middle attack can only succeed when the attacker remains undetected by impersonating each endpoint to their satisfaction.\nAccording to one illustrative embodiment, method for preventing Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks is provided. A first security digest generated by an endpoint device is compared with a second security digest received from a peer device. It is determined whether a match exists between the first security digest and the second security digest based on the comparison. In response to determining that a match does not exist between the first security digest and the second security digest, a man-in-the-middle attack is detected and a network connection for a Transport Layer Security session is terminated with the peer device. According to other illustrative embodiments, a computer system and computer program product for preventing Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks are provided.\nFIG. 1 is a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented;\nFIG. 2 is a diagram of a data processing system in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented;\nFIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating an example of a Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attack detection system in accordance with an illustrative embodiment;\nFIGS. 4A-4B are a flowchart illustrating a process for a Transport Layer Security session endpoint device in accordance with an illustrative embodiment; and\nFIGS. 5A-5B are a flowchart illustrating a process for a Transport Layer Security session peer device in accordance with an illustrative embodiment.\nThe present invention may be a system, a method, and/or a computer program product at any possible technical detail level of integration. The computer program product may include a computer readable storage medium (or media) having computer readable program instructions thereon for causing a processor to carry out aspects of the present invention.\nThe computer readable storage medium can be a tangible device that can retain and store instructions for use by an instruction execution device. The computer readable storage medium may be, for example, but is not limited to, an electronic storage device, a magnetic storage device, an optical storage device, an electromagnetic storage device, a semiconductor storage device, or any suitable combination of the foregoing. A non-exhaustive list of more specific examples of the computer readable storage medium includes the following: a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), a static random access memory (SRAM), a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), a digital versatile disk (DVD), a memory stick, a floppy disk, a mechanically encoded device such as punch-cards or raised structures in a groove having instructions recorded thereon, and any suitable combination of the foregoing. A computer readable storage medium, as used herein, is not to be construed as being transitory signals per se, such as radio waves or other freely propagating electromagnetic waves, electromagnetic waves propagating through a waveguide or other transmission media (e.g., light pulses passing through a fiber-optic cable), or electrical signals transmitted through a wire.\nComputer readable program instructions described herein can be downloaded to respective computing/processing devices from a computer readable storage medium or to an external computer or external storage device via a network, for example, the Internet, a local area network, a wide area network and/or a wireless network. The network may comprise copper transmission cables, optical transmission fibers, wireless transmission, routers, firewalls, switches, gateway computers and/or edge servers. A network adapter card or network interface in each computing/processing device receives computer readable program instructions from the network and forwards the computer readable program instructions for storage in a computer readable storage medium within the respective computing/processing device.\nComputer readable program instructions for carrying out operations of the present invention may be assembler instructions, instruction-set-architecture (ISA) instructions, machine instructions, machine dependent instructions, microcode, firmware instructions, state-setting data, configuration data for integrated circuitry, or either source code or object code written in any combination of one or more programming languages, including an object oriented programming language such as Smalltalk, C++, or the like, and procedural programming languages, such as the “C” programming language or similar programming languages. The computer readable program instructions may execute entirely on the user's computer, partly on the user's computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user's computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user's computer through any type of network, including a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider). In some embodiments, electronic circuitry including, for example, programmable logic circuitry, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), or programmable logic arrays (PLA) may execute the computer readable program instructions by utilizing state information of the computer readable program instructions to personalize the electronic circuitry, in order to perform aspects of the present invention.\nAspects of the present invention are described herein with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems), and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer readable program instructions.\nThese computer readable program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. These computer readable program instructions may also be stored in a computer readable storage medium that can direct a computer, a programmable data processing apparatus, and/or other devices to function in a particular manner, such that the computer readable storage medium having instructions stored therein comprises an article of manufacture including instructions which implement aspects of the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.\nThe computer readable program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer, other programmable data processing apparatus, or other device to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer, other programmable apparatus or other device to produce a computer implemented process, such that the instructions which execute on the computer, other programmable apparatus, or other device implement the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks.\nThe flowchart and block diagrams in the Figures illustrate the architecture, functionality, and operation of possible implementations of systems, methods, and computer program products according to various embodiments of the present invention. In this regard, each block in the flowchart or block diagrams may represent a module, segment, or portion of instructions, which comprises one or more executable instructions for implementing the specified logical function(s). In some alternative implementations, the functions noted in the blocks may occur out of the order noted in the Figures. For example, two blocks shown in succession may, in fact, be executed substantially concurrently, or the blocks may sometimes be executed in the reverse order, depending upon the functionality involved. It will also be noted that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustration, can be implemented by special purpose hardware-based systems that perform the specified functions or acts or carry out combinations of special purpose hardware and computer instructions.\nWith reference now to the figures, and in particular, with reference to FIGS. 1-3, diagrams of data processing environments are provided in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. It should be appreciated that FIGS. 1-3 are only meant as examples and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made.\nFIG. 1 depicts a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Network data processing system 100 is a network of computers, data processing systems, and other devices in which the illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Network data processing system 100 contains network 102, which is the medium used to provide communications links between the computers, data processing systems, and other devices connected together within network data processing system 100. Network 102 may include connections, such as, for example, wire communication links, wireless communication links, and fiber optic cables.\nIn the depicted example, server 104 and server 106 connect to network 102, along with storage 108. Server 104 and server 106 may be, for example, server computers with high-speed connections to network 102. In addition, server 104 and server 106 may provide one or more services, such as, for example, e-commerce services, financial services, banking services, governmental services, educational services, reservation services, data services, and the like, requiring secure connections with client devices for data security. Also, it should be noted that server 104 and server 106 may each represent clusters of servers in data centers. Alternatively, server 104 and server 106 may each represent computing nodes in cloud environments hosting different services.\nServer 104 and server 106 may utilize, for example, Transport Layer Security to provide the secure network connections for data security. Transport Layer Security is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide data communication security over a network. The network connection is secure or private because symmetric cryptography is used to encrypt the transmitted data. Session-specific cryptographic keys for the symmetric cryptographic encryption are uniquely generated for each network connection and are based on a shared secret that was negotiated at the start of the network session during the Transport Layer Security handshake procedure. The involved network devices negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before data is transmitted. It should be noted that if one of the handshake procedure steps fails, then the secure connection is not created. Transport Layer Security is the most widely deployed security protocol used today and is used for Web browsers and other applications that require data to be securely exchanged over a network, such as, for example, financial transactions, file transfers, virtual private network connections, email, instant messaging, voice over Internet Protocol, and the like.\nTo increase network security, server 104 and server 106 may also utilize Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) puzzles. CAPTCHA puzzles are a type of challenge-response test used to determine whether the service requesting user is a human or another computer where human interaction is essential to security. CAPTCHA puzzles require the user to simultaneously use invariant recognition, segmentation, and parsing to correctly answer the puzzle.\nNetwork activities, such as, for example, online e-commerce transactions, search engine submissions, Web polls, Web registrations, free e-mail service registration, and other automated online services, are subject to software programs (e.g., Web bots) that mimic human user behavior in order to skew results of automated tasks or perform malicious activities, such as gathering e-mail addresses for spamming or placing hundreds of orders causing denial-of-service. In order to validate the requesting user, the user is presented with a CAPTCHA puzzle, such as, for example, a distorted word placed on top of a distorted background. The user must input the correct word into a field in order to complete the validation process. Computers have a difficult time decoding the distorted word while humans can readily decipher the text. Some CAPTCHA puzzles utilize pictures or images instead of distorted words. For example, a user may be presented with a series of pictures and asked what is the common element among all of the pictures. By inputting the correct common element, the user is validated and the computer knows it is dealing with a human user and not a Web bot.\nClient 110, client 112, and client 114 also connect to network 102. Clients 110, 112, and 114 are client devices of server 104 and/or server 106. In this example, clients 110, 112, and 114 are shown as desktop or personal computers with wire communication links to network 102. However, it should be noted that clients 110, 112, and 114 are examples only and may represent other types of data processing systems, such as, for example, laptop computers, handheld computers, personal digital assistants, smart phones, smart watches, smart televisions, gaming devices, kiosks, and the like. Users of clients 110, 112, and 114 may utilize clients 110, 112, and 114 to access and utilize the services provided by server 104 and/or server 106.\nStorage 108 is a network storage device capable of storing any type of data in a structured format or an unstructured format. In addition, storage 108 may represent a plurality of network storage devices. Further, storage 108 may store identifiers and network addresses for a plurality of different client devices, identifiers for a plurality of different users, CAPTCHA puzzles and their corresponding answers, hash functions, and the like. Furthermore, storage unit 108 may store other types of data, such as authentication or credential data that may include user names, passwords, and biometric data associated with client device users, for example.\nIn addition, it should be noted that network data processing system 100 may include any number of additional server computers, client devices, storage devices, and other devices not shown. Program code located in network data processing system 100 may be stored on a computer readable storage medium and downloaded to a computer or other data processing device for use. For example, program code may be stored on a computer readable storage medium on server 104 and downloaded to client 110 over network 102 for use on client 110.\nIn the depicted example, network data processing system 100 may be implemented as a number of different types of communication networks, such as, for example, an internet, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), or any combination thereof. FIG. 1 is intended as an example only, and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.\nWith reference now to FIG. 2, a diagram of a data processing system is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Data processing system 200 is an example of a computer, such as server 104 in FIG. 1, in which computer readable program code or instructions implementing processes of illustrative embodiments may be located. However, it should be noted that data processing system 200 is not limited to a server. In other words, illustrative embodiments may be implemented in other types of data processing systems, such as, for example, peer devices. In this illustrative example, data processing system 200 includes communications fabric 202, which provides communications between processor unit 204, memory 206, persistent storage 208, communications unit 210, input/output (I/O) unit 212, and display 214.\nProcessor unit 204 serves to execute instructions for software applications and programs that may be loaded into memory 206. Processor unit 204 may be a set of one or more hardware processor devices or may be a multi-core processor, depending on the particular implementation.\nMemory 206 and persistent storage 208 are examples of storage devices 216. A computer readable storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information, such as, for example, without limitation, data, computer readable program code in functional form, and/or other suitable information either on a transient basis and/or a persistent basis. Further, a computer readable storage device excludes a propagation medium. Memory 206, in these examples, may be, for example, a random-access memory (RAM), or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage 208 may take various forms, depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage 208 may contain one or more devices. For example, persistent storage 208 may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage 208 may be removable. For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage 208.\nIn this example, persistent storage 208 stores Transport Layer Security session manager 218. However, it should be noted that even though Transport Layer Security session manager 218 is illustrated as residing in persistent storage 208, in an alternative illustrative embodiment Transport Layer Security session manager 218 may be a separate component of data processing system 200. For example, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 may be a hardware component coupled to communication fabric 202 or a combination of hardware and software components. Transport Layer Security session manager 218 controls the process of establishing a Transport Layer Security session with a peer device connected to a network, such as network 102 in FIG. 1. In addition, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 detects and prevents Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks between data processing system 200 and the peer device.\nAfter establishing the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 sends CAPTCHA puzzle 220 to the peer device. CAPTCHA puzzle 220 may represent a plurality of different CAPTCHA puzzles that Transport Layer Security session manager 218 utilizes for data security. Answer 222 represents the correct answer to CAPTCHA puzzle 220. It should be noted that Transport Layer Security session manager 218 may store CAPTCHA puzzle 220 and answer 222 in persistent storage 208 or may alternatively retrieve CAPTCHA puzzle 220 and answer 222 from a remote storage, such as storage 108 in FIG. 1, of a CAPTCHA puzzle service provider.\nFurther, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 selects segment 226 from Transport Layer Security session data 224, which corresponds to the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device. Segment 226 may be, for example, an initial or first portion of Transport Layer Security session data 224 that includes a predetermined number of bytes, such as the first 20, 30, 40, or 50 bytes of session data. However, it should be noted that segment 226 may consist of any portion or any number of bytes from Transport Layer Security session data 224. Transport Layer Security session data 224 represent information corresponding to the Transport Layer Security session that Transport Layer Security session manager 218 established between data processing system 200 and the peer device. Transport Layer Security session manager 218 sends information regarding the selection of segment 226 to the peer device in addition to CAPTCHA puzzle 220.\nFurthermore, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 utilizes hash function 228 to generate security digest 230. Security digest 230 is a hash of answer 222 and segment 226. Hash function 228 may be, for example, one-way cryptographic hash function.\nMoreover, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 compares security digest 230 with received security digest 232 to determine whether a match exists between security digest 230 and received security digest 232. Received security digest 232 represents a security digest, which Transport Layer Security session manager 218 received from the peer device, consisting of a hash of a user inputted answer to CAPTCHA puzzle 220 and segment 226. Transport Layer Security session manager 218 determines that a match exists between security digest 230 and received security digest 232 when the hash values contained in security digest 230 are the same as, or are equivalent to, the hash values contained in received security digest 232. Conversely, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 determines that no match exists between security digest 230 and received security digest 232 when the hash values contained in security digest 230 are different from, or are nonequivalent to, the hash values contained in received security digest 232. However, it should be noted that in alternative illustrative embodiments, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 may utilize other criteria to determine whether a match does or does not exist.\nIf security digest 230 and received security digest 232 match based on the comparison, then Transport Layer Security session manager 218 continues the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device. If security digest 230 and received security digest 232 do not match, then Transport Layer Security session manager 218 determines that a man-in-the-middle attack is occurring and performs mitigation action steps 234. Mitigation action steps 234 may include, for example, Transport Layer Security session manager 218 terminating the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device and/or sending an alert to a security analyst for review and possible action. However, it should be noted that if Transport Layer Security session manager 218 determines that security digest 230 and received security digest 232 do not match, then Transport Layer Security session manager 218 may allow a predefined number of retries, such as, for example, one, two, or three retries, before determining that a man-in-the-middle attack is occurring and performing mitigation action steps 234. Security session manager 218 may allow the predefined number of retries just in case the user, for example, inadvertently inputted a wrong answer to CAPTCHA puzzle 220 during an authentication attempt.\nCommunications unit 210, in this example, provides for communication with other computers, data processing systems, and devices via a network, such as network 102 in FIG. 1. Communications unit 210 may provide communications through the use of both physical and wireless communications links. The physical communications link may utilize, for example, a wire, cable, universal serial bus, or any other physical technology to establish a physical communications link for data processing system 200. The wireless communications link may utilize, for example, shortwave, high frequency, ultra high frequency, microwave, wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth® technology, global system for mobile communications (GSM), code division multiple access (CDMA), second-generation (2G), third-generation (3G), fourth-generation (4G), 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE), LTE Advanced, fifth-generation (5G), or any other wireless communication technology or standard to establish a wireless communications link for data processing system 200.\nInput/output unit 212 allows for the input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system 200. For example, input/output unit 212 may provide a connection for user input through a keypad, a keyboard, a mouse, a microphone, and/or some other suitable input device. Display 214 provides a mechanism to display information to a user and may include touch screen capabilities to allow the user to make on-screen selections through user interfaces or input data, for example.\nInstructions for the operating system, applications, and/or programs may be located in storage devices 216, which are in communication with processor unit 204 through communications fabric 202. In this illustrative example, the instructions are in a functional form on persistent storage 208. These instructions may be loaded into memory 206 for running by processor unit 204. The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit 204 using computer-implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory 206. These program instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code that may be read and run by a processor in processor unit 204. The program instructions, in the different embodiments, may be embodied on different physical computer readable storage devices, such as memory 206 or persistent storage 208.\nProgram code 236 is located in a functional form on computer readable media 238 that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system 200 for running by processor unit 204. Program code 236 and computer readable media 238 form computer program product 240. In one example, computer readable media 238 may be computer readable storage media 242 or computer readable signal media 244. Computer readable storage media 242 may include, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage 208 for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive, that is part of persistent storage 208. Computer readable storage media 242 also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system 200. In some instances, computer readable storage media 242 may not be removable from data processing system 200.\nAlternatively, program code 236 may be transferred to data processing system 200 using computer readable signal media 244. Computer readable signal media 244 may be, for example, a propagated data signal containing program code 236. For example, computer readable signal media 244 may be an electro-magnetic signal, an optical signal, and/or any other suitable type of signal. These signals may be transmitted over communication links, such as wireless communication links, an optical fiber cable, a coaxial cable, a wire, and/or any other suitable type of communications link. In other words, the communications link and/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non-tangible media, such as communication links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.\nIn some illustrative embodiments, program code 236 may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage 208 from another device or data processing system through computer readable signal media 244 for use within data processing system 200. For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage media in a data processing system may be downloaded over a network from the data processing system to data processing system 200. The data processing system providing program code 236 may be a server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code 236.\nThe different components illustrated for data processing system 200 are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to, or in place of, those illustrated for data processing system 200. Other components shown in FIG. 2 can be varied from the illustrative examples shown. The different embodiments may be implemented using any hardware device or system capable of executing program code. As one example, data processing system 200 may include organic components integrated with inorganic components and/or may be comprised entirely of organic components excluding a human being. For example, a storage device may be comprised of an organic semiconductor.\nAs another example, a computer readable storage device in data processing system 200 is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory 206, persistent storage 208, and computer readable storage media 242 are examples of physical storage devices in a tangible form.\nIn another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric 202 and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory 206 or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric 202.\nMan-in-the-middle attacks are one of the most common attacks for intercepting network session data between two connection endpoints. Man-in-the-middle attacks allow the attackers to eavesdrop and/or modify data content of a network session. A CAPTCHA puzzle can be easily solved by a human, but is more difficult for a machine to solve. However, CAPTCHA puzzles are still vulnerable to some well-articulated man-in-the-middle attacks, which allow the attackers to manipulate the data content of network sessions. Thus, illustrative embodiments also utilize Transport Layer Security on top of CAPTCHA puzzles. For those Transport Layer Security sessions where man-in-the-middle attacks are occurring, the Transport Layer Security session data on one peer device side is different from the other peer device side. Illustrative embodiments utilize a security digest, which consists of a cryptographic hash of a correct answer to a presented CAPTCHA puzzle and a selected Transport Layer Security session data segment, to detect and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The selected Transport Layer Security session data segment may be, for example, the first 32 bytes of the Transport Layer Security session data.\nUtilizing these two factors (i.e., CAPTCHA puzzle and Transport Layer Security session data segment), a Transport Layer Security session endpoint device and its peer device are both able to generate a security digest during the Transport Layer Security session negotiation between the two network devices. The two network devices generate the security digest using a hash function, such as a one-way cryptographic hash function (e.g., Secure Hash Algorithm 256). If the security digests do not match, then the Transport Layer Security session endpoint device ends the network connection. One reason the security digests do not match is because the Transport Layer Security session data segments do not match, which indicates a man-in-the-middle attack. Another reason the security digests do not match is because of wrong CAPTCHA puzzle answer, which indicates either the user input the wrong answer or a man-in-the-middle attack is occurring. As a result, illustrative embodiments can effectively prevent Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks and can be widely applied since Transport Layer Security is commonly used to protect network connections.\nWith reference now to FIG. 3, a diagram illustrating an example of a Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attack detection system is depicted in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attack detection system 300 may be implemented in a network of data processing systems, such as network data processing system 100 in FIG. 1. Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attack detection system 300 is a system of hardware and software components for detecting and preventing Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks between a Transport Layer Security session endpoint device, such as, for example, data processing system 200, and a Transport Layer Security session peer device, such as, for example, client 110 in FIG. 1.\nIn this example, Transport Layer man-in-the-middle attack detection system 300 includes Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 and Transport Layer Security session peer device 304. However, it should be noted that Transport Layer man-in-the-middle attack detection system 300 may include any number and type of Transport Layer Security session endpoint devices and Transport Layer Security session peer devices.\nTransport Layer Security session peer device 304 sends Transport Layer Security session request 306 to Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 to initiate establishment of a Transport Layer Security session between Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 and Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302. In response, Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 performs a Transport Layer Security handshake procedure with Transport Layer Security session peer device 304. Upon successful completion of the Transport Layer Security handshake procedure, Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 establishes a Transport Layer Security session with Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 and sends CAPTCHA puzzle 308 and Transport Layer Security session data segment information 310 to Transport Layer Security session peer device 304. CAPTCHA puzzle 308 and Transport Layer Security session data segment information 310 may be, for example, CAPTCHA puzzle 220 and information regarding selection of segment 226 of Transport Layer Security session data 224 in FIG. 2.\nSubsequently, Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 sends security digest 312 to Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302. Security digest 312 is a hash of a user inputted answer to the CAPTCHA puzzle and the Transport Layer Security session data segment corresponding to the segment selection information sent to Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 by Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302. Security digest 312 may be, for example, received security digest 232 in FIG. 2. If Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 determines that a match exists between security digest 312 and a security digest generated by Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302, then Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 sends security digest validation acknowledgement 314 to Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 and continues the Transport Layer Security session with Transport Layer Security session peer device 304. Alternatively, if Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 determines that a match does not exists between security digest 312 and the security digest generated by Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302, then Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 detects a man-in-the-middle attack and discontinues the Transport Layer Security session with Transport Layer Security session peer device 304.\nWith reference now to FIGS. 4A-4B, a flowchart illustrating a process for a Transport Layer Security session endpoint device is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process shown in FIGS. 4A-4B may be implemented in an endpoint data processing system, such as, for example, Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 in FIG. 3.\nThe process begins when the endpoint device receives a request to initiate a Transport Layer Security session with the endpoint device from a peer device (step 402). The peer device may be, for example, Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 in FIG. 3. The endpoint device performs a Transport Layer Security handshake procedure with the peer device (step 404). The endpoint device establishes a network connection with the peer device for the Transport Layer Security session upon successful completion of the Transport Layer Security handshake procedure (step 406).\nThe endpoint device selects a CAPTCHA puzzle to send to the peer device (step 408). The CAPTCHA puzzle may be, for example, CAPTCHA puzzle 220 in FIG. 2. In addition, the endpoint device retrieves a correct answer to the CAPTCHA puzzle (step 410). The correct answer may be, for example, answer 222 in FIG. 2.\nThe endpoint device sends the CAPTCHA puzzle to the peer device via the network connection (step 412). Further, the endpoint device selects a segment of Transport Layer Security data corresponding to the Transport Layer Security session (step 414). The segment of Transport Layer Security data may be, for example, segment 226 of Transport Layer Security session data 224 in FIG. 2. The endpoint device sends information regarding the selection of the segment of Transport Layer Security data to the peer device via the network connection (step 416).\nFurthermore, the endpoint device, using a one-way cryptographic hash function, generates a first security digest based on a hash of the correct answer to the CAPTCHA puzzle and the selected segment of Transport Layer Security data (step 418). The one-way cryptographic hash function may be, for example, hash function 228 in FIG. 2. The endpoint device also makes a determination as to whether a second security digest was received from the peer device within a defined period of time (step 420). The defined period of time may be, for example, thirty seconds, one minute, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes, or the like.\nIf the endpoint device determines that a second security digest was not received from the peer device within the defined period of time, no output of step 420, then the process proceeds to step 434. If the endpoint device determines that a second security digest was received from the peer device within the defined period of time, yes output of step 420, then the endpoint device compares the first security digest generated by the endpoint device with the second security digest received from the peer device (step 422).\nAfterward, the endpoint device makes a determination as to whether a match exists between the first security digest and the second security digest based on the comparison (step 424). If the endpoint device determines that a match does not exist between the first security digest and the second security digest, no output of step 424, then the endpoint device detects a man-in-the-middle attack (step 426) and the process proceeds to step 434 thereafter. If the endpoint device determines that a match does exist between the first security digest and the second security digest, yes output of step 424, then the endpoint device sends a security digest validation acknowledgement to the peer device (step 428). The security digest validation acknowledgement may be, for example, security digest validation acknowledgement 312 in FIG. 3. In addition, the endpoint device continues the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device (step 430).\nSubsequently, the endpoint device makes a determination as to whether an input was received from the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session (step 432). If the endpoint device determines that an input was not received from the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session, no output of step 432, then the process returns to step 430 where the endpoint device continues the Transport Layer Security session with the peer device. If the endpoint device determines that an input was received from the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session, yes output of step 432, then the endpoint device terminates the network connection with the peer device (step 434). Thereafter, the process terminates.\nWith reference now to FIGS. 5A-5B, a flowchart illustrating a process for a Transport Layer Security session peer device is shown in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. The process shown in FIGS. 5A-5B may be implemented in a peer data processing device, such as, for example, Transport Layer Security session peer device 304 in FIG. 3.\nThe process begins when the peer device sends a request to initiate a Transport Layer Security session with an endpoint device (step 502). The endpoint device may be, for example, Transport Layer Security session endpoint device 302 in FIG. 3. The peer device performs a Transport Layer Security handshake procedure with the endpoint device (step 504). The peer device establishes a network connection with the endpoint device for the Transport Layer Security session upon successful completion of the Transport Layer Security handshake procedure (step 506).\nAfterward, the peer device receives a CAPTCHA puzzle from the endpoint device via the network connection (step 508). Subsequently, the peer device receives an answer to the CAPTCHA puzzle from a user of the peer device (step 510). In addition, the peer device receives information regarding a selection of a segment of Transport Layer Security data corresponding to the Transport Layer Security session from the endpoint device via the network connection (step 512). In other words, the peer device receives the Transport Layer Security session data segment selection information and gets that selected segment of data from the Transport Layer Security session according to the segment selection information.\nThe peer device, using a one-way cryptographic hash function, generates a security digest based on a hash of the answer inputted by the user to the CAPTCHA puzzle and the segment of Transport Layer Security data corresponding to the segment selection information received from the endpoint device (step 514). Afterward, the peer device sends the security digest to the endpoint device for validation via the network connection (step 516).\nThe peer device makes a determination as to whether a security digest validation acknowledgement was received from the endpoint device within a defined period of time (step 518). If the peer device determines that a security digest validation acknowledgement was not received from the endpoint device within the defined period of time, no output of step 518, then the peer device detects a man-in-the-middle attack (step 520) and the process proceeds to step 526 thereafter. If the peer device determines that a security digest validation acknowledgement was received from the endpoint device within the defined period of time, yes output of step 518, then the peer device continues the Transport Layer Security session with the endpoint device (step 522).\nSubsequently, the peer device makes a determination as to whether an input was received from the user of the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session (step 524). If the peer device determines that an input was not received from the user of the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session, no output of step 524, then the process returns to step 522 where the peer device continues the Transport Layer Security session with the endpoint device. If the peer device determines that an input was received from the user of the peer device to end the Transport Layer Security session, yes output of step 524, then the peer device terminates the network connection with the endpoint device (step 526). Thereafter, the process terminates.\nThus, illustrative embodiments of the present invention provide a computer-implemented method, computer system, and computer program product for preventing Transport Layer Security session man-in-the-middle attacks between data processing devices connected to a network.
